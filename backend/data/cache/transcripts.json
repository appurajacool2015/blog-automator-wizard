  "12YlKk40YAI": "Hey guys, Lovable 2.0 just dropped with a bunch of new amazing features to make it even easier to build and deploy real world applications, even if you're not a coder. And in today's video, we're going to look at the five biggest updates of Lovable 2.0. And then you're going to see all of these updates in action as we go off and build a beautiful website just like this, completely from scratch, only using prompts inside of Lovable. And we're going to build it in less than 10 minutes. And because you guys are awesome, I'm giving away a custom GPT that I've created for you guys that helps you create the perfect prompts for Lovable to help you build beautiful websites even faster. Just check out the link in the description below so you can download it for free. Also, don't worry if you're not a coder. Lovable 2.0 has made it even easier to build full stack applications to where even your grandma can do it, which is why I'm so excited to talk about everything in this new release. Also, huge shout out to lovable for sponsoring this video. I've been using them for a while to build my own websites just like this one. And I've loved how easy and simple they've made it to build beautiful websites, which is why I was so excited when they reached out to collaborate to talk about this new release. But enough talking, let's go ahead and cover the five big features that you want to see and go ahead and dive into the live build. So, the first and my favorite update inside of Lovable 2.0 is they've really upped the bar on their visual editing platform. At this point, you can click on any element inside the web application you're building and you have total control over it. You can update the text, the text size, the padding, pretty much anything that you can think of, you can directly control through a guey. And this is a huge improvement from where we were a few months ago where if you wanted to make changes, you would either have to hook the project up to code and you manually go change it elsewhere or you would have to spend an extra credit to say, \"Hey, can you please make the text this much bigger?\" So, this is a huge improvement to make it more cost-effective and easier to use to get better results. Super excited about this first update. And the second feature I'm super excited about is Lovable is now fully supporting dev mode, which means you can easily toggle back and forth between prompt and preview and code and preview. So if you're a developer like me and you want to get your hands dirty, you can easily now do it. And my favorite part is all of the changes you make, you can easily press save and it will save it directly to GitHub, which is a huge improvement of where we were a while ago to where you would have to manually edit everything over in GitHub and import it back in. Now it's just super easy to all edit in one place. Super excited for you guys to try this one out. And the third new feature you're going to see inside of Lovable 2.0 is their new chat mode agent. And I can go ahead and tell you this thing is a beast. You can use it to ask questions about your project or you can have it help you debug issues. Or my favorite is you can use it to plan out big changes and updates inside your applications. And it's great because you get to make sure you and the agent are on the same page before it goes off and makes changes. But once you are both on the same page, it has a nice little button for you that says implement changes and then it just takes care of the rest for you from there. Absolutely love this one. Super excited for you guys to try this one, too. And the fourth new feature you're going to see inside of Lovable 2.0 is their new multiplayer mode, which allows you to bring in your friends, co-workers, and other contributors to your projects so that you all can work on the same project. This one is amazing because in the past, everything inside of Levable was single player. So, it was pretty much you working on it. If you wanted to make changes, you had to send it over to GitHub where you could have other people to start to work on the project. But now you can all work in one unified workspace, which is Lovable, and make all the changes you guys want, and you can share all the billing credits under one account. Absolutely love this feature. And the fifth major update you're going to see inside of Lovable is you can now buy your own custom domains all inside the application. I absolutely love this one, especially for beginners, because now you don't have to hop across all these different websites to go off and buy your own beautiful domain. and you're actually going to see me later in the video go off and buy AI with Brandon.ai and you're gonna see how just how easy it is to buy it and actually start hosting your website on your own custom domain. Excited for you guys to see this one in just a bit. And as a quick extra bonus, I wanted to show you guys some pricing changes that they've made to make everything simpler and more transparent and honestly more affordable. So, let me walk you through the old pricing super fast so you can see what it used to be. So, back in the day, what it was is they had multiple tiers. everything from starter to launch to scale to teams and everything was based around daily limits and then on top of that it was monthly limits. So there were just a lot of moving parts uh and ultimately if you were using lovable a ton you would eventually hit scale and once you hit scale it was confusing cuz it's like I just want more credits. Now I'm having to deal with monthly limits. So it was all around kind of confusing. But now to make things more transparent, more clear, and like I said, more affordable, they've simplified it to now a free tier, a pro tier, and a team uh team tier on the free tier. So, if you just sign up for Lovable today, you'll get five daily credits. So, you can log in, actually crank out a beautiful website completely for free, and you can actually see it. The only gotcha is it's going to be public so other people can see your source code, but it's still a great way to get started and try out the product. Then once you're saying, \"I'm addicted and I can't stop using it now.\" You will hop over to the pro tier, which is 25 bucks a month for 100 credits per month. And what's so nice about this is everything's credit based. So one credit equals one message. And if you want more credits, great. There's uh will be a drop down right here. And you can say, I'd like 200 monthly credits, 300, 400, 500. And basically every 100 credits is around $25. And you can do a ton with a 100 credits. You'll see in just a second when we go build out the application how many credits we use to actually build a beautiful website. So you're going to see, you know, we can go really far with 100 credits. And you're going to get some other features, too. So private project, so you can hide your project so other people can't see the source code. You can invite other editors to start doing the multiplayer mode. And you can start to bring in your own custom domain. So you're going to see all this in just a second. So yeah, those were the five plus one bonus new features inside of Levable 2.0. So now let's go ahead and hop over to the live build so you can see all these features in action. All right guys, welcome to lovable.dev. So this is what the updated version of Leovable looks like. And I'm super excited for us to dive into the live build in just a second. But if this is your first time looking at lovable, I just want to give you a quick tour. So right when you log in, you can easily just type in your prompt right here and create a beautiful web application. As you go off and create real world projects, they'll be able to uh access all of the active projects you have right down here. And then if you're looking for inspiration, they have a from the community tab. So you can see in real time all the different projects that people are working on to get inspiration and just see what people are making. So absolutely love it. Now in our case, we are going to be doing a live build to showcase all the new features that you just saw. And as I mentioned at the very beginning of the video, I have built a special GPT for you guys that will create the perfect prompt for you guys to make building a website inside of Lovable so easy and just make the results honestly beautiful. Lovable already does a phenomenal job and this just helps you with getting the ideas out of your head and into a prompt. So all you need to do is click the link down description below to go over and get this GPT prompt generator. And what it'll do is it'll walk you through a few quick questions about like, hey, what are you trying to build? you know, what's the goal and what you're trying to do from there. And after answering a few questions, it's just going to go off and generate a beautiful document that's going to contain all the information needed for Lovable to create an amazing website for you. So, it's cranking out so much code. So, what I've done is I've copied the code. Um, and what we're doing in our case is saying, \"Hey, please build me a portfolio website so that I can say, \"Hey, here's all my YouTube content, and if you want help building out AI agents, come work with me.\" That's all we're trying to do. That's all the GPT has done. So, what we can do is just paste in the result from the GPT and give it over to Lovable. From there, Lovable is going to take in our huge prompt that's going to contain everything from the copy for the website, the style of the website, and everything else needed to go off and create our website. And it's going to spin out and start cranking up an entire Nex.js application completely completely for for free and super fast. Just if you remember from the beginning, you get five free credits. So, this could be one of your credits to go off and create the initial part of your application. So, we're going to give it a second while it's going off and cranking out our website, and we're going to pop right back in once it's done building. Okay, guys. So, it took just a few more seconds to go off and build our website. But look how amazing the final result is. And this is after a single prompt. This is crazy how good it did. So, as you can see, we have a amazing hero section saying like, \"Hey, AI with Brandon, email me. Here's some information about me.\" and just continual call to actions. We'll fix some of these buttons in a second, but overall amazing for the first attempt. From there, I told the prompt that I wanted to showcase my latest YouTube videos. So, it did a great job of making a new section to showcase all my videos. Don't worry, in just a little bit, we'll actually put in real videos, you know, just to help you get ideas on how you can actually interact with lovable and make changes. And then from there, it has an awesome footer section to where it's like, hey, once again, call to action. Do you want to work with me? Cool. you know, help I'll help you build out your AI agents. Just email me and here's some examples of what I can work on. So, all around crazy that it did this in a single, you know, a single try. So, what we're going to do next is start working on showcasing how you can start to use some of the new features to fix and make improvements to the application that you just built inside of Lovable. Okay. So, the first thing I want to show you guys is the new visual editor. So, in order to make changes to a specific component inside of our application, we can click the edit button down here. And what it'll do is it'll go, okay, great. Which application do you want to change? So, in our case, what I want to do is update this span right here. So, specifically, what I want to say is, hey, please drop the email icon here. And basically what we can do is it'll go off and it'll make the change in real time to where it's going to say, \"Okay, I understand where in the source code this icon is at. I'm going to remove it, save the file, and then I'll update the preview.\" So this should take just a second to go ahead and fix the email button. So you can see in real time it's editing it. It should be changing it, and it dropped it. Okay, great. So now we have fixed that part of the code. And now what we can do is once again try it on somewhere else. So, we have the edit button toggled. So, let's go ahead and do this edit. And in this case, the cursor flashing keeps happening in the wrong spot. So, um you can also see inside of here, we can change anything as well. So, we can update the, you know, the style of the text. We can change anything that we wanted to. So, in our case, what I want to do is just say, let's say discard because I clicked the wrong thing. So, discard. Sorry about that. And what we'll do is click this section right here and just say, \"Hey, there are some issues with the cursor inside of this component. It is always on the right, sorry about that, long day side of the screen. So then what we can do now is send it off and it'll go, okay, hm, why is that happening?\" It'll go off and fix it. So all around this is just crazy that we can just type to lovable it give it the issues we're having. It'll analyze the code and then from there it'll go off and make the fixes in order to actually make the changes happen. Uh so we can get rid of bugs which is crazy because once again nothing so far has required you to understand code. All you need to do is just identify a problem and then translate it and tell it to lovable for it to go off and make the necessary changes. So, we're going to give it just a second to go off and quickly update this cursor issue real quick, and then we're going to showcase some of the other features inside of Lovable 2.0. So, we gave Lovable a few more seconds, and it was able to fix the typewriter effect. So, now it's looking flawless to where it's typing in and out my different things that I do instead of having the cursor over here randomly. So, this looks amazing. So, now let's go ahead and look at one of the next features, which was going to be the chat feature. Now, this one is crazy how good it is. So, let me show it to you. So, what you can do is click chat. And as you can see, when you click chat, it's gonna allow you to work with lovables agent that is going to understand what you want before making changes. So, let me show you this in action. So, what we're going to say now is go, okay, I would please like to make some changes to this YouTube section. I don't want to have all of these different category tags that you can see right here. And then when it comes to my actual videos, I don't want to show these placeholders. I want to show my actual videos. So here are links to all of my videos and the title for each one of those videos. So now what we can do, like I said, click chat and then press enter. What this is going to do in our case is come up with a big plan of going, okay, I understand the website's current state. I understand what you want and now I am working and brainstorming a new plan of how I can make this come to action and what I'm going to do to you is present this plan in real time so you can see all the changes I want to make. So I want to update the gallery. So I want to get rid of all the current stuff. Then what I want to do is actually enhance the video data. So everything's fake right now. It's mock data. And I want to show the real YouTube ID. So when someone clicks it, it takes them over to YouTube. And then I want to make the each one of these card elements more beautiful. So right now um you know we just have very light animations and I want to make it look a lot prettier. So this is what it's recommending. And then like I mentioned earlier, this thing is a beast. So once you're on the same page as it, you can just click the implement the plan and it'll go off and make all the code changes. And that's exactly what we're going to do. So this takes just a few more seconds to go off and actually look through all the different code and look at the plan and make all the changes. So, we're going to give this a few more seconds so you can see implement this plan in action. So, after just a few seconds, Lovable was able to crank out the plan that we gave it. And the updates are crazy. So, now you can see it's pointing out to all of my videos that I've been working on on my YouTube channel that I gave it. So, you can see it has beautiful like nice little effects for each one. So, now we can have like a nice little play button and when I actually hover over it, it, you know, shows a nice animation. So, all around it did a great job showcasing my portfolio. And now what I want to do is dive into one of the other features that Lovable just dropped, which was their inline code editor. So you don't need this if you're not a developer, but if you are a developer, I just want to showcase how powerful it is. So what we're going to do inside the code is drop this section right here. So this was just like a madeup quote and we're just going to get rid of it. So what we can do is in the top right hand corner, there's a new button that allows you to switch over to dev mode. So once you're in dev mode, you can see all your source code. And to get a better sense in of the code, you can actually collapse this editor over here on the lefth hand side. So now you're just in full code mode. And this is where you can see everything inside of your Nex.js application. In my case, you know, if you're familiar with Nex.js code, you can see all the different things in here. And I believe this will probably be the work with me section. Yeah, this is definitely the work with me section. And we're going to scroll down to the bottom cuz this is where it made up that one quote that I don't want anymore. And I can easily come in here and delete it. So I'm just going to press delete. And what's amazing is now what you can do is just click save changes. In the past this used to be a big sticking point because what you had to do was go all right lovable. Sorry you're actually connected up to GitHub. Don't worry if you don't know about GitHub. Um, but basically you're saving all your changes to uh GitHub and now what you have to do is go make changes in a different editor and then save those changes, push them back up, reloadable. It used to be a whole ordeal, but now you're just directly making the changes right here inside of Level. And it's so easy to do. It's crazy. So now you can just click save changes. Everything should uh take just a second to save everything to GitHub. And now whenever you look back at the preview, you can see that it completely dropped that random quote at the end. So, that was so easy to make some amazing changes. And now what we can do is open back up our editor over here and everything's great. You can see that we just saved some changes in our code editor. Now, if you did want to add it back, something else that Lovable does that just makes it super easy. If you ever make a mistake, you can easily just click restore and you'll go back and undo a change. So, I can just show it to you real fast. So, if we want to get rid of that code change, we can just click restore. It'll take us a few seconds to actually load everything back up. It's working on undoing those changes. Success. We restored. And now it's back. But hey, I don't want it. I just wanted to show you guys that it does work. So, it takes just a second. So, all right guys. So, now what we're going to do is head over and start looking at how we can start to publish our application and buy your custom domain now that we have a perfect beautiful website uh spun up. And publishing is super easy. All you need to do is in the top right hand corner, click publish. Now, what this will do is it will automatically by default publish to a lovable domain for you. So, lovable.app is where it'll all get published and whatever the name of your application is. So, up here in the top left, that's usually what the domain you're going to be given. So, you're just going to click publish. And what this will do is it'll take a few seconds, but it's like packaging all the code together, deploying it for you, handling all that complexity, so you never have to worry about it. So, now you can see your app is fully deployed. So you can click the little link and it'll take you to your website to where you can see it in all of its glory. And this thing looks amazing, guys. And we did this in like a few minutes. It's crazy that we could build all of this in a few minutes. So all round absolutely crushed it. Love what Lovable has done, hence the name. So now what I want to do is walk you through the process of buying your own domain inside of Lovable just so you can see how easy it is and how you can update the domain you deployed to. So, you're not deploying to lovable, you're deploying to your own URL. So, we're going to go ahead and walk through it real quick. First thing you need to do is click manage. When you click manage, it'll take you to the settings page and it'll give you two options. If you already have your own domain that you've bought somewhere else, click add domain. But if you want to buy it through Lovable, I would uh just click this link right here, and it'll take you over to this page right here. So, it's going to take a second to spin up. I think they're just getting a ton of traffic right now. So, it's a little slower to start, but we're going to give it a few seconds and then we're going to come back and start trying to buy our own domain. All right, so what you need to do, go ahead and delete whatever it has in here and type in whatever domain you want to. And it has some extra cool features that you'll see in just a second where it includes AI to help you come up with ideas. But go ahead and type in your first domain by default. So, in my case, I'm going to do AI with Brandon. Make sure I spelled it right. Yep. Andai. And we're going to go ahead and click check availability. Now what this is going to do is say all right is this domain available in my case it is. So what I can do is buy the domain. Now for whatever reason if this domain was not available you can actually search for other domains. So down here let me zoom in for you guys so you can see it a little bit better. So you can see down here what we can do is search for other ones. So if this one doesn't work and I was going to be like Brandon does AI, I can search with generated uh domain name. So, I'm going to say Brandon Brandon AI developer developer. And then we can click generate domains and it'll go off and search for us to be like, okay, based on what you want to do, here's other domains that you could buy. And some of them are stupid cheap. And then other ones aren't. I definitely want to go for a.com, aapp, or aai. So, I'm not going to look at those. And I'm going to go back to add to cart. And I'm quickly just going to buy everything. So, you know, it's a two-year subscription. Just to give you guys an update on like pricing, I've bought domains, other AI domains, and they usually run me around $69 per year. So, this is honestly a really good deal. So, I'm going to go through the process of buying it real quick and then once it's done, we're going to hop back over and I'm going to show you how you can change to deploy your apps uh your own app to your own new website. So, give me just a second. Oh, and something else I just want to show you that pops up immediately next is Lovable gives you the option to easily hook up Google Workspace. So, if you want to have your own custom email, so in my case it would be Brandon at AI with Brandon, I could easily click add to cart and this would give me that email capabilities. But I'm going to skip it for now and just buy strictly the domain. So, one second and then we'll be right back. So, I just bought a domain and this is what the screen looks like after you're done where it says like, hey, you brought the domain and it's going to be automatically configured to work with lovable. It could take some time for everything to get configured, but we should be good to go. So, we're going to click finish. And then we're going to, in our case, go back to publish. And now what we can do is see that we have two different domains now. So, we have our current one that came automatically. And now we have a new one. Now, you can see it's spinning cuz it's taking some time to officially connect everything. So, you can see it's just pending. So, what we're going to do is take a quick pause while it's in that 10-minute grace period. And as soon as it's ready, we'll go ahead and record it. And I'll show you guys how you can fully deploy and we'll go check everything out. So, it took about 10 minutes just like it said it would. And now everything is officially connected. No more white dot. And what you can do is if you go off and publish right now, what'll happen is it will now publish to both of our domains, which is super nice. It's one click and we get everything deployed to both of our different domains. Now, this isn't going to work. However, I'll show you why. So, u if you click right now, it's going to go and take you to this failed site. So, what we need to do is if you bought a domain just like me, what you'll do is you'll go over um you'll get some emails saying like, \"Hey, here's your link to login.\" And in our case, we need to activate this SSL thing, which is basically allowing, you know, secure HTTPS, which stands for hypertext transfer protocol secured. And that's what we're trying to do. So, we're just went to do the activate now, the SSL starter kit one. It takes a second then everything is officially Yeah. Everything is officially secure. So you just click wait a second and I agree. I agree. I agree. Set up SSL. I'm going to download the private key. So yeah, tada. You now have officially made your website secure. So you're not going to get that issue anymore. So I just want to show you guys that cuz that definitely was tripping me up at first until I realized what was going on. So now it probably will take a little bit to propagate everything. None of this stuff is instant. We'll update one more time just to make sure. But yeah, usually anything related to buying a domain, setting up all these uh certificates takes extra time. So don't get freaked out if it takes, you know, a little bit up to sometimes an hour or so to uh to officially be connected. But now, yeah, we're going to give it a little bit more time and I'll let you guys know once it's ready to go. So I gave it a little bit more time and now everything is golden. So now whenever I click to go off to my website, now it officially directs everything over to where you can see AI with Brandon. We have our beautiful website built with lovable. We have some amazing looking animations. You can click to email me where it'll be directed to actually, you know, sending me an email to work with me. You can see all the videos I've been working on and you can, you know, once again say, hey, call to action. You want to build an AI agent, work with me. And once again, this was all created with Levelable, which is crazy. I'll actually have a link to this uh website down in the description below so you can see it yourself and test it out just because I think this thing is amazing. So, I hope you guys are as excited about Lovable 2.0 as I am. And I definitely recommend checking out the link in description below so you can head over and check out Lovable yourself to start creating your own beautiful websites. And also, if you would like to see me to do a deeper dive into Lovable and connecting up to Superbase to start building out deeper full stack applications, definitely drop a comment down below so that I know that you guys want it and I can build it for you guys. But yeah, definitely recommend checking out all the other videos I have on my channel and cannot thank you guys enough for watching this one today. See you. Talk to you in the next one. Bye.",
  "bPtKnDIVEsg": "hey guys in today's video I'm going to show you how you can deploy agents from Google's new agent development kit to the cloud More specifically I'm going to walk you through the full process of deploying your agents to Google's agent deployment service called Agent Engine And by the end of this video you'll have your first agent deployed to the cloud ready to respond to your real world request And because you guys are awesome I'm going to be giving away all the source code in this video plus some step-by-step instructions completely for free so you can build and deploy your own agents on your own time Just check out the link down description below so you can go ahead and download everything today And don't worry if you're new to Agent Development Kit or the cloud I'm going to be breaking down everything step by step so it's as easy as possible to follow And if you get stuck or have questions for whatever reason feel free to drop a comment down below Or you can head over to my free school community where you can talk with me and other like-minded AI developers so we can get you unstuck and moving on your projects But enough talking let's go ahead and do a quick overview of the core technologies you're going to be using today so that we're on the same page And then we're going to head over to the five steps you need to follow to deploy your local agents to the cloud So let's go ahead and dive in All right guys So before we dive into actually building out and deploying all of our agents to the cloud we need to understand the core two technologies we're going to be using today Agent Development Kit and then Vertex AI agent engine So let's explain what they are and how they work together to deploy agents All right first things first is going to be agent development kit Agent Development Kit is Google's new agentic framework that allows you to build out agents So if you've used Langchain or Crew AI Lum Index any of these agent frameworks it is exactly like that So you'll probably recognize a lot of these instructions for creating an agent to where you pass in a model that you want the agent to use Give it a name and then pass in some instructions on like all right agent Here's exactly what you need to go off to do So it should be super familiar to you A few other cool points to note is agent development kit You can actually pass in any model So you could pass in an open AI model a cloud model any of them You're not stuck using the Gemini models from Google And it is completely free to use just like it is to use link chain or crew AAI It's actually an open source repository so you can actually go in look at the source code download it make pull request whatever you want to do Now that's how we're going to create our agents And then now we need to talk about step number two which is going to be deploying our agents And we're going to do that through Vert.Ex AI agent engine This is Google's platform to make agent deployment as easy as possible Without a tool like this creating agents and actually deploying them can be a ton of work and they've done a really good job of simplifying the whole process and making it super affordable So a few things that you need to know inside agent engine you can actually pass in any type of framework you want So I think they have a really good chart down here that explains it all So within agent engine this is where you'll actually be like deploying all of your agents You can actually pass in any agent framework you want You could pass in crewi lang chain llama index any agent framework you want You can pass it in and deploy it through agent engine And then once a agent is deployed you can actually go off and make requests to it almost like you would just a regular API So you can say like hey agent take in this request Agent engine is going to host it deploy it and actually run the agent and then spit back the answer to you Makes it super super easy to do And a few other things that I think are pretty cool that you would like to know is when it comes to pricing it's actually super super affordable It is a pay as you go model to where you only pay as the agent is running which is super important to me because I don't want to be racking up a huge bill of like hundreds of dollars if the agent only gets triggered once So basically the way it works is you know whenever you send a request off to the agent it's going to start tracking its time and say \"Okay cool It looks like I ran for a total of 3 minutes.\" And along the way I used 10,000 tokens So you're automatically going to pay for the tokens you use And then on top of that you're going to pay for the resources that you used So you can see you're going to pay basically for CPU usage and memory So if you were to run all in all for an hour you can expect to pay around 11 cent if you used one core and 1 gigabyte So all around very affordable which was I was super impressed with So very excited that they've made it easy to deploy and basically very affordable as well All right So now that we've talked about what are the two tools we're using now it's time for us to actually go ahead and see how we're going to create our agents with Agent Development Kit and then easily go ahead and deploy them over to Agent Engine over in Vertex AI So if you have any questions on any of that feel free drop a question down below I know these are some like more advanced bigger topics but let's go ahead now and head into the five core steps you need to go from agent to deployed agent So let's go ahead and dive in Okay so now that we've talked about the two tools you're going to be using Agent Development Kit and Agent Engine let's go ahead and cover at a high level the five steps you need to take to deploy your agents to the cloud So first things first we are going to create an agent using ADK So I already have a pre-built one for you that you can just go ahead and download for free down in the description below Once we have our agent set up on our local computer then we need to go ahead and start setting up our cloud resources So first we're going to go ahead and create a new project in Google Cloud Platform From there inside Google Cloud Platform we're going to enable and set up our AI resources Once we have the cloud set up to support all the AI functionality we're on our local computer going to installed Google Cloud CLI This is going to allow us to log in access our cloud resources and it's going to enable us to connect to Vertex AI so that we can actually start to run our agent locally because it'll have access to our Gemini keys and everything else we need to run it And then finally once it's up and working and everything's installed we can then go ahead and deploy our agent to the cloud And I have scripts and everything else that you need to make this as easy as possible Like I said I've tried to break down everything step by step So let's go ahead and hop over to the first step where we are going to look at the agent that we are going to deploying to the cloud today So let's go ahead and hit to step number one So welcome to step number one where we're going to do a quick overview of the agent that we're going to be deploying to the cloud today So at a high level what we're doing is I've built a shortbot agent for you guys which all it does is this agent takes in a message and then makes it as short as possible to get the same message across So as you can see this looks just like lang chain and crewi where you pass a name model and description You pass in your instructions here where you basically go ahead and say like hey this is the task you're trying to perform And what you can also see is you can pass in tools just like you would normally do with lang chain or crewi So inside the tools you just go ahead and make a normal Python function give it a parameters give it the types give it a dock string of what it should do and then all the code that needs to run Like I said this is more of a deployment tutorial so we're not getting super fancy with the underlying agent Okay so first things first I have set up instructions for you guys so that you can easily install this and run it locally So if you head over to the readme after you download this source code for free what you can see is I have basically step-by-step instructions to where you guys can you know go ahead and install the project And to install it you're going to need to use Poetry Don't worry if you run into any issues drop a comment down below or you can go ahead and actually talk to Tit and it'll walk you through installing Poetry on your local computer Once you have installed Poetry all you need to do is run poetry install and this is going to go off and install all the necessary dependencies that you need to actually run this project Everything from the Google Agent Development Kit which is the main one and all the other tools you need for deploying and everything else So that's what's going on at a high level And then what you can do next is go ahead and activate the environment that you just created And what this will allow you to do is actually run commands Specifically what you can do now is down here what I've showed you guys is you can actually go ahead and start to run your agent Now what you can do is just type in ADK web And what this will do is it'll go ahead and spin up the web version of this agent so that you can begin to chat with it Now I am going a little bit of ahead and step four will actually go ahead and install Google Cloud which will connect you to Vert.Ex AI which will actually allow you to like go ahead and start running this So this won't work out of the box until we do step four I just want to go ahead and give you a quick overview of the agent So if we head over here you can see we're now in the web view of our agent So up here on the top left you can see all of our agents that we have running And then we can go ahead and start to type in messages that will get sent to our shortbot So we can say \"Hey how was your weekend?\" We can say \"Anything fun have fun with the family.\" And then what it'll do is it'll go ahead and send that message off to our agent And then our agent will go ahead and type a response back Sorry I actually this is on me I I meant to refresh the page So if we go ahead and send it again what it'll do is it'll go ahead and actually run And you can see what I've told the agent to do is give me the original character count the new character count and the new message So you can see basically what it did is like hey this was kind of redundant and what it did is it made it shorter So you can see the agent's up and running You can dive in to you know seeing the events that happened the initial request that was being passed in the response Don't worry if any of this is confusing I'm actually going to after this video create a agent development kit quick start where I dive deeper and I'm also going to create an agent development kit masterass So I'm going to have a lot more content coming out around this but today I just wanted to focus on deployment So as you can see our agent is actually up and running and it works And you can see that there are instructions that will walk you through exactly how to install your agent and get everything running Okay cool So we are officially done on the setup The only other things that I do want to mention that are very important for you to understand how it all works at a high level for agent development kit is the fact that the way agent development kit works is you create agents through folders So you can see we have an ADK shortbot that is going to be the name of our agent and then within this folder you can see I create an agent.py file Well that's basically how it works This is kind of how they want their structure of agent set up So you can see name of agent here Then we give the instructions for the agent This name needs to match this name It's very important that they match folder and project name So that was just one thing that tripped me up whenever I first created agents in agent development kit So yeah So that's everything that you need to know at a high level when it comes to creating your agents And we're going to go ahead and head over to step number two where we're going to start walking you through actually getting everything set up for the cloud Let's go ahead head over to step number two So welcome to step number two where we're going to create your Google Cloud Platform account and the project that you're going to be using to manage all the resources for our deployed agent So first things first inside of Google just type in GCP cloud and you should see a link to that will point you over to Google Cloud So we're going to go ahead and click that Now what we need to do next is if you've never created a Google Cloud account before you're going to want to go ahead and sign up to create an account It should be completely free to do If anything you might need to hook up a payment method It's not going to charge you anything but you might be asked to connect a payment method just so that you can access some of the newer features You won't be charged until you run anything so don't worry about that but just wanted to point that out as an important note Great Once you've signed up now it's time for us to go ahead and go over to our console So you're going to click console And what this will do is it'll take you to inside of Google Cloud Platform Now if you see a screen like this yours might be a little bit different if you've never created a project before but as you can see on my screen I can see I'm in the Brandon Hancock.io workspace and I'm working on the deploy ADK quickart project Together we're going to go ahead and create a new project from scratch so that we're working from the same area So what I'm going to go ahead and do is click new project And I'm going to call this ADK shortbot YouTube So this is the name of my project You don't the naming really doesn't matter It's just something that you'll easily memorize and recognize when you see it Now what you want to do next is click the billing account So in my case I have two billing accounts You probably will now have one billing account because you went through the setup process So click that And then when it comes to your organization I only have one And then location I only have one either So uh it should be pretty much just like this except reflect your information So next we're going to go ahead and click create And this will take a few seconds to create your new project spin up all the resources and get everything ready Now once it's done you can click this button right here to select your project And you can see in the top left it now shows we're working inside the new project If for whatever reason that didn't happen you can always just click up here in the top left and research all the projects that you have and click the proper one So great we now are done with step two So let's go ahead and head over to step number three where we're going to enable all of our AI resources So welcome to step number three where we're going to start enabling all of the AI services inside of your Google Cloud project so that we can start to deploy our agent So first things first what do we need to do we need to enable Vertex AI So what we can do is in the top of our search bar type in Vertex AI and you should see a search result just like this We're going to click Vertex AI and then we are going to click enable all recommended APIs And this is going to create Vertex AI Studio and everything else that you need in order to start working with you know Vert.ex AI And a quick reminder Vertex AI is also going to enable us to start using agent engine which is the most important thing that we're trying to use here Now this does take quite a few seconds to create So if you click on this little notification bell in the top rightand corner you can see all of the different resources and services that it's enabling Everything from compute notebooks data flows everything that you need And you can see it also went off and created a bunch of other services right here So we're going to let that run And then what we also need to do is create a new bucket where we can start to store our deploy agents And what is important to note about this I'm just going to show you an existing project so you can see it in action This is something that I created a while ago And you can see I made a bucket which is where we're going to basically store our deployed agents And you can see I made previously an ADK shortbot and it got deployed to this bucket And if you dig in you can actually start to see some of the like all the different folders and resources stored in order to actually run our agent So all this is going to get stored to the cloud Okay So that's what we're ultimately trying to do So what we can type in is bucket And if you go to cloud storage bucket this is what we're trying to do And we need to create a new one So in our case you're going to click create And then from here we're just going to give it a simple name So I'm going to call it the same name as my project So ADK shortbot YouTube And then we can pretty much click continue for everything else Now it is important to note that this will cost money you know but it's like insanely cheap So you can see it cost almost 3 cent per gigabyte per month and we're going to be using barely anything So like we might get charged a penny per month with what we're doing here So don't worry about it Like we're not going to be breaking the bank So click continue Pretty much click continue through everything and the defaults are usually great enough And we're going to click and continue The next one is what we want to do is this one is important Enforce public access prevention Basically what this mean is hey can the outside world access our stuff and the answer is no We do not want the outside world accessing information in this bucket So that is important that it stays checked So we're going to click continue We're going to use the normal soft delete policies and click continue Basically go ahead and just click everything as the default and you should be good So great our bucket is now set up Things are great And if you go back to our notification bell you can also see that everything has been set up properly Fantastic Now there's one last piece that we need to work on together So if you just click back to the root menu which you can click on Google Cloud it'll take you back to the root We need to copy over a few pieces of information over to our bucket So we need to copy two things One we need to copy the project ID So you can click copy And basically what we're doing is we are trying to update our environment to say \"Hey AI agent where do you want me to deploy and use all my project resources?\" That's exactly what we need to set up So when it comes to Google Cloud Project we're going to put your new project name here For cloud location we're just going to use the default which in my case was US Central 1 I would recommend using this one as well Basically you could use any of the deployed AI enabled locations There's a huge list I think about 30 different places that enable access to AI features but US Central 1 works So I would definitely recommend using this The final thing we need to do is say hey where is the bucket that you want me to deploy resources to so what you can do is go ahead and type in click cloud storage which will take you back to your bucket You're going to click buckets Then when you click ADK shortbot or whatever name you gave it what you can do is you can find the name for it right here So whatever name pops up right here that is the name of your bucket So you can come back over here paste it in Fantastic You now have your project set up to where it's pointing to all of your cloud resources And that's everything that you need to do now that you've enabled all of your AI resources set up your bucket and you've updated your environment variables So now what we can do is go ahead and head over to step number four where we're going to start setting up Google Cloud CLI to connect your local computer to all of your cloud resources So let's go ahead and head over to step number four So welcome to step number four where we're going to set up the Google Cloud CLI on your local computer And this is what's going to allow you to do two things One it's going to allow you to actually run your local agents properly because it's going to give you access to Gemini on your local computer to where it's going to pull down all the credentials and give you access to running it And two it's going to give you the ability to start deploying your agents to Google Cloud Now why are we doing this well if you actually head over to the agent development kit quick start guide you can see there is a step to where it's like all right cool In order to actually start to use these large language models which option do you want to do to access the LLM service and in our case we are using Vertex AI because that Vertex AI is what also gives us access to agent engine So this is exactly why we're following the steps So as you can see it says to set up Google Cloud CLI So what you can do is click this link or in the readme docs I have a link for you to follow to So what you want to do click this link and it'll take you to a website that looks just like this where it's going to say okay here are the different platforms you can install Google Cloud CLI on And in my case I'm on a Mac So all I needed to do was you obviously are going to click whatever platform you're using but in my case I'm on a Mac and I'm using Apple Silicon So I went ahead and clicked this and then I downloaded it Once I downloaded it all I needed to do was run this command that it tells you to run And this is going to go ahead and install it on your local computer So literally just follow these instructions And then once it's installed all you need to do is run Google Cloud Unnit What this is going to do is allow you to start to run Google Cloud anywhere on your computer So once you run Google Cloud init it's going to add it to your path So you can at any point anywhere just run Google Cloud and it'll start to work on your computer just like this Great So I'm going to run Google Cloud init with you because we also need to set up and connect our project to actually point to the proper project So when you're first using it it's going to ask you to do two things It's probably going to ask you to log in So let me just show you that as well So you're going to run g-cloud login And what this will do is actually ask you to sorry G-Cloud off login So what this is going to ask you to do is go ahead and log in to your account So I'm going to log in And then once you log in you're going to say \"Yes I want to accept all of these different permissions.\" Great You're now logged into Google Cloud CLI And you can start to run any of the things that you want to do and actually have access to Google Cloud Then what we can do is run Google Cloud And this is where we're going to go ahead and start setting up our local environment to start pointing to the proper projects So yours is going to not show this because you're doing this for the first time So you're going to probably just walk through the like hey what project would you like to set up in my case I'm going to say hey I want to reinitialize this to point to the proper project So I'm gonna say one I'd like you to show me all my potential projects And I'll point to the right one And before I do that it's going to ask which account would you like to use to perform in my case you saw me just log in with my email So that's exactly what I'm going to do Then it's going to show me all of my existing projects Now in my case we just created this project So number one so this is the project I'm going to pick You obviously want to pick the project you created in Google Cloud Then it's going to say do you want to configure a default zone we're not going to worry about that for now And now you can see hey congrats You are ready to start using Google Cloud and it's connected to this project So fantastic You have actually set up Google Cloud to work locally on your computer And what's really cool is now you also have ability to run that ADK command I showed originally that ADK web where it actually spins up the local agent that we created and runs it Now that we have access to Vertex AI and all of our Gemini keys and everything else that are just automatically created under the hood you can now start to actually run this as well So this is where you can start to come in here pick an agent Let's actually go ahead Sorry I'm running this from the wrong folder I was like why is it showing all those random files so sorry You can actually run it here ADK web And this is where it'll show all of your different potential agents that you have And this is where you can start to run it all So ADK and then hey how are you so just to show that's working So it's going to run It's going to go trigger it It's going to original count new count Fantastic So everything is looking good So we now have our agent up and running And we are now at the final step where we're going to start walking through how we can start to deploy this agent that we've created now to Google Cloud now that we've set up and connected everything So let's go ahead and head to step number five So welcome to step number five where we're now going to dive into deploying your agents over to agent engine And before we just start running through the code where you're going to see exactly how to deploy these agents I want to walk you through a few core concepts you need to understand first So when we're actually looking at the code in just a second you understand oh yeah that is what's happening and I understand why all the different parts are moving the way they are Okay So let's look at a few of the most important things first So what we've done so far is we have created an agent and now that agent can run locally on our computer and what we're trying to do is two things One we want this agent to get bundled up into a container and deployed over to Vertex AI engine That's exactly what we're trying to do here And under the hood when we dive in the code you're going to see that this is actually super straightforward You really will do two things You are going to create the engine and it's going to be called a reasoning engine cuz we're basically almost like building a chat agent is what we've done so far And so we're creating a reasoning engine And all we're doing is passing in our root agent which is our shortbot And what we're doing is saying \"Hey enable tracing.\" And once you've created your agent and it gets wrapped and turned into an application all we need to do is then deploy it And we're going to dive more into the code in just a second but what we're going to do is create a deployment And how this works is you say agent engine please create a new engine And all you do is pass in this application right here And it's going to take all of the different agents sub agents tools It's going to package it all together and deploy it over to agent engine And you need to specify two other things Any requirements So basically it's all getting bundled and packaged together So if there's any specific packages your agents use like if you're building a weather application and you needed to use like a Python weather SDK or anything like that you would start adding all of those additional packages right here So weather SDKs if you were using some other fancy libraries you'd pass them all right here And then when it comes to extra packages what you want to do is put the name of your package So in our case if you actually go look at the code that I wrote you can see that everything that we're trying to deploy is in the ADK_Shortbot package So that's exactly what we've done over here where we just say \"Hey the only package you need to deploy is ADK shortbot because this includes all the agents you need for deployment.\" So that's what we're putting there So that's the only thing you need to put in the extra packages Okay check We've walked through high level what's happening Now there's a few core pieces of terminology you need to understand before we start deploying these to the cloud So so far you've seen how we can create a deployment and we run this Python code and it actually deploys it off to agent engine and what that's going to do is create a deployment A deployment is nothing more than all the instructions needed to run the agent So it's just sitting there waiting to be used Then what we can do is create a session And a session is nothing more than saying okay I would like to use this deployed agent and now I'm going to start having a conversation with it So a session is nothing more than a conversation with an agent So hopefully that makes sense So let me show you some examples of this in action When we were using our ADK web earlier in the browser you saw how we could chat with our agent So you can say we're chatting with this agent And every time we create a new conversation it's going to add a new session And if you remember a session is nothing more than messages So if you actually click into a session what you'll notice is it just shows this It just shows a summary of all the messages we pass back and forth between us and the agent If we had more tool calls it would show the tool calls in here And that's pretty much everything you need to know when it comes to deploying agents There's deployments and there's sessions Deployments contain all the instructions and packages and everything needed to run the agent and sessions are actual conversations with messages with that specific deployed agent Okay so hopefully that makes sense and you kind of see how the dots connect And don't worry we're going to actually now that you've seen these highle concepts we're going to hop over to the code deploy our agent go ahead and start creating new sessions And once we've created a session you're going to see us actually start chatting with the agent back and forth So let's go ahead and hop over to the code where we're going to start taking action on everything you just learned All right guys So welcome to the code portion of deploying your agents to agent engine And before we dive in to look at the code I just want to mention that I've created a script for you guys to make deployment as easy as possible And I've tried to set it up in a way to where you can just type in the command line and perform all the actions that you would like to do Specifically I have set up the code in a fashion so that you can create and delete and list all of your deployments that you've made to agent engine And then outside of that I've also set it up so that you can look and start to chat with all the sessions that you create because you remember sessions are where we chat to And then finally I've set it up so that you can easily send messages and start to chat with your deployed agents in one of these sessions So this will make more sense and we're going to actually walk through it part by part So don't worry if any of this is confusing We're going to go step by step and hit each one of these Okay so first things first what we need to do is create our own agent and deploy it to agent engine This is the exact same code that you guys saw earlier where we're going off and first creating the application and then deploying the agent application to Google Cloud App Engine So here's what we need to do If you come down to your terminal you can type in poetry run and then you can type in deploy remote Now let me break down each part of this so it actually makes sense on why we're doing each thing So poetry this is what we're using for our package management And what we're doing is saying \"Hey I would like you to run this script.\" So where the heck is this script defined great question If you head back over to pipro.tl you can see that I've created a script for you guys which is deploy remote And deploy remote calls the deployment python file and it calls remote sorry it goes to the deployment folder calls the remote Python file and runs the main function So that's exactly what we have So here is our deployment folder with our remote Python file and then inside of that we are trying to run this main function So that's exactly what we have here folder file function Okay cool Hopefully that makes sense So now what we're going to do is we would like to go ahead and create our deployment of our agent So I'm going to run it first just so you can see how it works We're not actually deploying and creating it yet I just want to show you that it's going to give you all the possible options that you can run to basically use this deploy script In our case we're trying to create our deployment which is going to push our local agent to the cloud So we're going to run at the very end of this command d-create And I'll make it a little bit bigger for you guys so you can see too So now when I run create what it's going to do is go thank you for giving me everything that I need I'm going to install all the proper dependencies that I need And then from there once I know everything I need to install I'm going to use that bucket that you created earlier and we set up in our environment variable files And I'm going to start saving everything over to our Google storage bucket So I'm going to save all the instructions dependencies and I'm going to go ahead and build this agent and save it in a zip file over to our bucket And then once it's saved everything to the cloud things are happy Then it's going to kick off agent engine and saying \"Hey you here's all the raw ingredients you need Now please go forth and deploy this agent.\" And you can actually look at the progress of this agent in real time to see where it's at in the deployment process Quick heads up this can take like up to 10 minutes to deploy an agent So you know get a cup of coffee and wait But let me show you what's going to happen in real time So if we click on that link we can look at the logs the deployment logs in real time So let me go ahead and make this full screen for you guys So what we can see is we are in our correct project And then you can see in real time it is going through the entire deployment process So you can see let me zoom out Oops Sorry It doesn't like being in this like half state So you can see in real time what it's doing is it is going okay cool all those packages you put in listed in our Google storage bucket I'm going to go ahead and download everything in the bucket that you told me to download And I can actually show this to you in real time So if we hop back over over here and we go to our cloud storage bucket you can see that our new everything that we talked about is actually deployed So you can see in our agent engine folder you can now see it has all of our requirements So you can see if I was to actually look at this So we'll go ahead and look at it just so you can see it So you can see it has all of the proper dependencies needed to actually run this agent And then what it's doing is it's downloading everything and those requirements file And from there what it's doing is it's installing all the dependencies in real time And what it's trying to do is fully download create the container and get it ready to be fully deployed on agent engine So what I'm going to do is do a quick pause and we're going to come back once the agent is fully deployed because like I said it can take up to 10 minutes And I'll show you that it's running once it's done deploying All right guys So it just deployed our agent to agent engine and we can confirm that it properly deployed it by running the list deployments command So you can see we have an extra function in here that's going to say \"All right agent engine please list out all the deployments so I can see what's actually been deployed to the cloud.\" So to run this all we need to do is go back and see what available commands we have to us And in our case we want to run the list command So come back up here type in list And now we should see that we have a deployed agent on agent engine Fantastic This is the exact agent we wanted to deploy Now we can move forth with creating a new session And a session is nothing more than a conversation between us and our deployed agent And the important variables that you need to pass in when creating a session are the resource ID So this is like hey what deployed agent should I talk to Also which user is talking with the agent This doesn't need to exist anywhere else Like this you know usually would just come from your application And the reason agent engine put this in here is so that at any point you could go up and look to figure out all the different conversations a specific user has had with a specific agent So that's why they put it here It's really just to help you list out sessions later on So let us go ahead and try it out So we're going to copy the resource ID because that's what we needed And in this time what we're going to do is run the create session command This is what we're running this time So we're going to type in create session Create session And then pass in the resource ID And if you don't pass in a user ID specifically it just uses test user by default So that's totally fine with me So we're going to go ahead and create our session And this will take a few seconds and showcase the new session results So tada You can now see I just created your session for you Here's the new session ID Here's the user ID in our case test user and everything else you need to know about the new session with our agent Great So now that we have that set up what we can do is fetch that specific session just to show that it was created properly So what we can do you can see we have a get session flag We'll actually skip it and we're just going to go ahead and chat with the session But just know you could list out all your sessions for our specific user and you could grab a specific session to see all the message history But in our case let's go ahead and have fun and send the specific message So going back to earlier we need to call the send flag So in our case send is the new command we're trying to run So we're going to type in send And now we can look up what information do we need to provide Well resource ID we have that What else do we need to provide we need to provide the user ID In our case this was just test user And then finally we need to pass in the session ID So session ID you can grab that right here And then what we need to do is pass in the actual message itself So you can see message right here So d- message And now we can just say like hey how did your weekend go anything fun and then we can send this off to our agent And what we should see back in just a few seconds is our agent responding back to us So you can say \"We sent this message How'd your weekend go?\" And then we got back this response So the original character count was 38 I shortened it to 23 just by saying \"Hey how was your weekend?\" So all around it did a good job of shortening the entire thing So all around super impressed And that is us actually communicating with our deployed agent This isn't local This is a deployed agent running in the cloud to where it's running doing its thing So all around I thought this is amazing Now let me go ahead and we're going to hop over next just as a bonus session I want to show you how you can start to look at traces and logs of these deployed agents Let's go ahead and look at that real quick Okay so as a bonus I wanted to show you guys how you could look at traces for your deployed agents And a trace is nothing more than a specific set of messages that have been passed back and forth It's how you can actually see what's going on between your agent and your users So all you need to do back inside Google Cloud what you can do is type in traces and you'll should see something called trace explore That's exactly what we want to click Once you click trace explore you can start to see all the different messages that have been sent between you and your customers So you can see we have an invocation which goes ahead and if you click on it you can see how it says \"All right this trace shows that agent specifically the ADK shortbot was called.\" Then you can see well what did that agent do well it called an LLM Then you can dive in here to see everything that happened So you can see we called Gemini Flash 2.0 You can see that we gave an instruction saying like \"Hey your message is shortening assistant Here's what you should do.\" You can see the response from the LLM So you can actually see everything that happens inside of your agents going through traces So this is a really cool way to like look back and see like hey what has been happening inside of my agent is it been performing properly you can you know if you wanted to you could do some filters here to say like hey I only want to look at LLM calls that have happened and see well what are the LLM calls that happen so you can actually dig in and see everything here I thought traces was a super cool functionality and definitely wanted to show it to you guys cuz now you're an expert at deploying agents to agent engine and this is a next step that you could look in to see how your agents are performing And just a

  "35eI7y1BFEE": "नमस्कार दोस्तों, मैं हूं आपकी दोस्त जहानवी और आप सबका स्वागत करती हूं। फिर से एक नई इंटरेस्टिंग और इनफेटिव वीडियो में हमने अपने चैनल पर कुछ समय पहले कंसिस्टेंट कैरेक्टर्स के साथ एआई स्टोरी वीडियो बनाने का ट्यूटोरियल अपलोड किया था। और इन एi स्टोरी वीडियो बनाने के लिए हमने आर्ट फ्लो एआई का इस्तेमाल किया था। लेकिन आर्ट फ्लो में स्टोरी इंग्लिश लैंग्वेज में ही बनती है। लेकिन हमने आपको उस वीडियो के लास्ट में आर्ट फ्लो से जनरेट स्टोरी वीडियो को हिंदी और बंगाली लैंग्वेज में भी दिखाया था। तो उन हिंदी और बंगाली स्टोरी वीडियो के एग्जांपल को देखकर आप लोगों ने हमें उस वीडियो पर बहुत कमेंट किए हैं कि हम पार्ट थ्री लेकर आए और आप लोगों को इंग्लिश के अलावा दूसरी लैंग्वेज में भी स्टोरी वीडियो बनाना बताएं। तो आज की वीडियो में हम आपको बताएंगे कि कैसे हमने आर्ट फ्लो से जनरेटेड वीडियो हिंदी और बंगाली में बनाया था और उन स्टेप्स को फॉलो करके आप भी हिंदी या किसी दूसरी लैंग्वेज में स्टोरी वीडियो बना सकते हैं। तो चलिए वीडियो को स्टार्ट करते हैं। सबसे पहले आपको जाना है आर्ट फ्लो एi वेबसाइट पर। इस वेबसाइट का लिंक भी आपको नीचे डिस्क्रिप्शन में मिल जाएगा। अब देखो जो लोग मोबाइल का इस्तेमाल करेंगे तो उन्हें पहले अपने ब्राउज़र को डेस्कटॉप मोड में ऑन कर लेना है। उसके बाद आर्ट फ्लोi की वेबसाइट ओपन करनी है। आर्ट फ्लो इ पर आपको अपना अकाउंट क्रिएट कर लेना है। आर्ट फ्लो पर आप अकाउंट टेम मेल से भी क्रिएट कर सकते हैं। अकाउंट क्रिएट करने के बाद आपके सामने कुछ इस तरह का इंटरफ़ेस ओपन होगा। अब हमें लेफ्ट हैंड साइड में कुछ ऑप्शंस दिखाई दे रहे हैं। तो यहां पर ऑप्शन है स्टोरी स्टूडियो। इस पर हमें क्लिक करना है। उसके बाद यहां राइट हैंड साइड में ऑप्शन है न्यू स्टोरी। इस पर क्लिक करना है। अब हमारे सामने यहां दो ऑप्शन है। पहला है हेल्प मी गेट स्टोरी। दूसरा है आई हैव ए स्टोरी। अगर आपके पास पहले से कोई स्टोरी नहीं है और आप आर्ट फ्लो एi से ही स्टोरी जनरेट करना चाहते हैं तो आप पहले ऑप्शन हेल्प मी गेट स्टोरी के साथ जाएंगे। और अगर आपके पास पहले से कोई स्टोरी लिखी हुई है तो आप दूसरे ऑप्शन आई हैव ए स्टोरी के साथ जाएंगे। अभी हम दूसरे ऑप्शन आई हैव ए स्टोरी के साथ जाएंगे। और यहां पर आई हैव ए स्टोरी पर क्लिक करते हैं। अब हमें इस बॉक्स में हमें अपनी स्टोरी को पेस्ट करना है। लेकिन अभी हमारे पास कोई स्टोरी तो है नहीं। तो स्टोरी हम चैट जीपीटी से लिखवाएंगे। तो इसके लिए हम चैट जीपीटी पर आते हैं। और अपनी स्टोरी जनरेट करने के लिए चैट जीपीटी को हम एक कमांड देते हैं। राइट ए स्टोरी विद मैक्सिमम थ्री कैरेक्टर्स एंड आल्सो डिस्क्राइब कैरेक्टर्स। लुक अबाउट ए ब्रेव बॉय ह्यू लॉस्ट इन जंगल। अब देखो आपको जिस टॉपिक पर भी अपनी स्टोरी जनरेट करनी है अबाउट के बाद अपना वर्ड टॉपिक आप यहां एंटर कर देंगे। उसके बाद अपनी कमांड को यहां से रन करेंगे। और कुछ ही सेकंड्स में चैट जीपीटी ने हमें यहां स्टोरी जनरेट करके दे दी है। अब हमने यहां पर चैट जीपीटी को मैक्सिमम तीन कैरेक्टर्स की स्टोरी जनरेट करने के लिए कहा है। तो इसका कारण यह है कि आर्ट फ्लो में हम मैक्सिमम तीन कैरेक्टर्स ऐड कर सकते हैं और साथ ही हमने चैट जीपीटी को हर कैरेक्टर्स के अपीयरेंस को भी डिस्क्राइब करने के लिए कहा क्योंकि जब हम अपनी खुद की स्टोरी से आर्ट फ्लो में स्टोरी वीडियो बनाएंगे तो हमें अपने कैरेक्टर के लुक को भी डिफाइन करना है। अब हम अपनी स्टोरी को कॉपी करते हैं और आर्ट फ्लो में आकर यहां इस बॉक्स में पेस्ट करते हैं। अब ऊपर अपनी एनिमेशन वीडियो के लिए विजुअल स्टाइल सेलेक्ट करना है। तो यहां हम चिल्ड्रन स्टोरी को सेलेक्ट करते हैं। अब उसके नीचे हमें अपने कैरेक्टर्स को ऐड करना है। तो कैरेक्टर्स के लिए वापस चैट जीपीटी पर आते हैं। और अपने पहले कैरेक्टर के नाम को कॉपी करते हैं और यहां कैरेक्टर्स नेम वाले बॉक्स में पेस्ट करते हैं। और इस कैरेक्टर्स के लुक डिस्क्रिप्शन को चैट जीपीटी से कॉपी करते हैं और कैरेक्टर्स के सामने वाले बॉक्स में पेस्ट करते हैं। इसी तरह दूसरे कैरेक्टर्स के नाम को कॉपी करते हैं और कैरेक्टर्स नेम वाले बॉक्स में पेस्ट करते हैं। दूसरे कैरेक्टर के लुक डिस्क्रिप्शन को कॉपी करते हैं और दूसरे कैरेक्टर्स के सामने वाले बॉक्स में पेस्ट करते हैं। इसी तरह तीसरे कैरेक्टर्स के नाम और लुक डिस्क्रिप्शन को कॉपी करके पेस्ट कर लेते हैं। अब देखो यहां पर हम मैक्सिमम तीन कैरेक्टर्स ऐड कर सकते हैं। इसीलिए हमने चैट जीपीटी से मैक्सिमम तीन कैरेक्टर्स की स्टोरी जनरेट करने के लिए कहा था। अब थोड़ा नीचे आएंगे और यहां क्रिएट दिस स्टोरी पर क्लिक करेंगे। अब हमें यहां हमारी वीडियो का एस्पेक्ट रेशो और सेलेक्ट करना है। जिस फॉर्मेट में भी हम अपनी वीडियो क्रिएट करना चाहते हैं। अगर आपको रील या शॉर्ट्स के लिए वीडियो बनानी है तो आप वर्टिकल यानी पहले ऑप्शन को सेलेक्ट करें और अगर आप लॉन्ग वीडियो यानी YouTube के लिए वीडियो बनाना चाहते हैं तो YouTube फॉर्मेट को सेलेक्ट करें। तो अभी हम YouTube फॉर्मेट को सेलेक्ट कर लेते हैं। उसके बाद यहां हमें अपनी एनिमेशन स्टोरी वीडियो के लिए विजुअल स्टाइल सेलेक्ट करना है। यहां बहुत से विजुअल स्टाइल है। आपको जिस स्टाइल को भी सेलेक्ट करना है। सिंपल आप उस स्टाइल पर क्लिक करेंगे तो वह स्टाइल यहां सेलेक्ट हो जाएगा। अभी हम विजुअल स्टाइल में 3D कार्टून को सेलेक्ट करते हैं। उसके बाद नीचे कंटिन्यू टू कैरेक्टर क्रिएटर पर क्लिक करेंगे। अब यहां कुछ देर प्रोसेसिंग चलेगी। तो थोड़ा वेट करते हैं। अब हमारी स्टोरी के अकॉर्डिंग यहां कैरेक्टर्स जनरेट हो चुके हैं। अगर आपको यह कैरेक्टर पसंद आते हैं तो आप नीचे कंटिन्यू टू स्टोरी बोर्ड पर क्लिक करेंगे। और अगर आपको कोई कैरेक्टर पसंद नहीं आ रहा है, आप कैरेक्टर दोबारा जनरेट चाहते हैं, तो आप यहां एडिट कैरेक्टर पर क्लिक करेंगे और जो भी आप अपने कैरेक्टर में चेंज करना चाहते हैं, वह सब आप इस बॉक्स में लिखेंगे। उसके बाद जनरेट कैरेक्टर इमेज पर क्लिक करेंगे, तो आपका कैरेक्टर आपके चेंज के अकॉर्डिंग क्रिएट हो जाएगा। लेकिन यहां एक बात का ध्यान रखें जब भी आप अपनी तरफ से नया कैरेक्टर जनरेट करेंगे तो आपका यहां क्रेडिट खर्च होगा। लेकिन अभी हमें यही कैरेक्टर रखना है। अब यहां ऊपर कंफर्म कैरेक्टर इमेज पर क्लिक करेंगे। उसके बाद कंटिन्यू टू स्टोरी बोर्ड पर क्लिक करेंगे और वापस यहां कुछ देर प्रोसेसिंग चलेगी। तो थोड़ा सा वेट करना है। अब हमारी स्टोरी के अकॉर्डिंग यहां इमेज जनरेट हो चुकी है। सबसे पहले आप इमेज में कंसिस्टेंसी देखिए। सभी इमेज कंसिस्टेंसी के साथ जनरेट हुई है। हर सीन के लिए हमें यहां पर दो इमेजेस मिले हैं। अब आपको जो इमेज इसमें पसंद आती है, आप उस पर क्लिक करेंगे, तो वही इमेज यहां उस सीन में सेलेक्ट हो जाएगी। [संगीत] अब हमने यहां इमेज जनरेट कर ली है। देखो यहां तक कि प्रोसेसिंग में हमारा यहां कोई भी क्रेडिट खर्च नहीं होता है। यानी अपनी स्टोरी वीडियो के लिए कंसिस्टेंट कैरेक्टर्स इमेज हम यहां एनालिमिटेड टाइम जनरेट कर सकते हैं। अब देखो अगर आप कंप्यूटर इस्तेमाल करते हैं और इंग्लिश में स्टोरी वीडियो जनरेट करना चाहते हैं तो आप यहां एक्सपोर्ट पर क्लिक करके वीडियो को एक्सपोर्ट कर सकते हैं। लेकिन अगर आप मोबाइल यूजर हैं तो फिर आप इस वीडियो को मोबाइल पर एक्सपोर्ट नहीं कर पाएंगे क्योंकि मोबाइल पर यह एक्सपोर्ट फीचर वर्क नहीं करता है। लेकिन मोबाइल यूज़र्स को घबराने की कोई जरूरत नहीं है। अब क्योंकि हमें स्टोरी वीडियो हिंदी में बनानी है तो पहले हम इन इमेज को यहां से डाउनलोड करेंगे। अब इमेज डाउनलोड करने के लिए इमेज के ऊपर कर्सर को लेकर आएंगे। राइट क्लिक करेंगे और सेव इमेज एज पर क्लिक करेंगे और सेव करके इमेज को डाउनलोड कर लेंगे। और अगर आप मोबाइल में कर रहे हैं तो जिस इमेज को डाउनलोड करना चाहते हैं उस इमेज पर अंगूठे से थोड़ा देर प्रेस करेंगे तो इमेज डाउनलोड करने का ऑप्शन आ जाएगा तो आप वहां से डाउनलोड कर लेंगे। अभी हम इस वीडियो को भी यहां से एक्सपोर्ट कर लेते हैं ताकि हम लास्ट में आर्ट फ्लो एi से जनरेट की गई वीडियो और हमारे तरीके से जनरेट की गई वीडियो का रिजल्ट कैसा होगा। तो अभी हम पहले चैट जीपीटी पर वापस चलेंगे और अपनी स्टोरी को उस लैंग्वेज में ट्रांसलेट करेंगे जिस लैंग्वेज में हमें अपनी स्टोरी वीडियो बनानी है। तो इसके लिए हम चैट जीपीटी को एक कमांड देंगे। ट्रांसलेट अबव स्टोरी इन हिंदी। तो अभी हमें स्टोरी वीडियो हिंदी में बनानी है। तो हमने हिंदी लिखा है आपको। जिस लैंग्वेज में भी अपनी वीडियो बनानी है, आपको हिंदी की जगह वह लैंग्वेज लिखनी है और उसके बाद अपनी कमांड को यहां से रन करना है। और चैट जीपीटी ने अब हमारी स्टोरी को हिंदी में ट्रांसलेट कर दिया है। अब हम अपनी वीडियो के लिए वॉइस ओवर जनरेट करेंगे। तो वॉइस ओवर के लिए हम इस्तेमाल करेंगे 11 लैब्स का। इस पर आपको अपना अकाउंट क्रिएट कर लेना है। अकाउंट क्रिएट करने के बाद आपके सामने कुछ इस तरह का इंटरफ़ेस ओपन होगा। यहां टेक्स्ट टू स्पीच वाले ऑप्शन पर क्लिक करेंगे। और अब इस बॉक्स में हमें अपनी स्टोरी को पेस्ट करना है। तो चैट जीपीटी से अपनी स्टोरी को कॉपी करते हैं और यहां इस बॉक्स में लाकर पेस्ट करते हैं। उसके बाद यहां वॉइस वाले ऑप्शन पर आएंगे तो हमारे सामने वॉइसेस ओपन हो जाएगी जिन्हें आप यहां प्ले पर क्लिक करके सुन सकते हैं। अब जो वॉइस आपको अपनी वीडियो में इस्तेमाल करनी है। उस वॉइस पर क्लिक करके वॉइस को सेलेक्ट कर लेंगे। अब वॉइस ओवर जनरेट करने के लिए यहां नीचे जनरेट स्पीच पर क्लिक करेंगे। तो कुछ ही सेकंड की प्रोसेसिंग में 11 लैब्स ने हमारी स्टोरी का वॉइस ओवर जनरेट कर दिया है। जिसे हम यहां डाउनलोड पर क्लिक करके डाउनलोड कर लेंगे। अब हम चलेंगे अपने वीडियो एडिटर में। अभी हम कैप कट वीडियो एडिटर का इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं। आप किसी भी वीडियो एडिटर का इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं। अब अपनी एडिटर में अपनी स्टोरी का वॉइस ओवर और कैरेक्टर्स इमेज को इंपोर्ट करना है। अब पहले अपनी स्टोरी के वॉइस ओवर को टाइमलाइन पर लाएंगे। उसके बाद वॉइस ओवर के अकॉर्डिंग वन बाय वन सभी इमेजेस को टाइमलाइन पर एडजस्ट करेंगे। [संगीत] इमेज को वॉइस ओवर के अकॉर्डिंग अच्छे से एडजस्ट करने के बाद अब अपनी इमेज पर एनिमेशन अप्लाई करेंगे। तो हम यहां एनिमेशन वाले ऑप्शन पर क्लिक करते हैं और कॉम्बो एनिमेशन में आते हैं और यहां से पेंडुलम वन, पेंडुलम टू, राइट ज़ूम, लेफ्ट जंप जैसी एनिमेशन स्कोर अप्लाई करेंगे। बाकी आपको कोई दूसरी एनिमेशन अपनी वीडियो के अकॉर्डिंग अच्छी लगती है तो आप उसे अप्लाई कर सकते हैं। हमने आपको पेंडुलम वन, पेंडुलम टू जैसी अप्लाई करने के लिए इसलिए बताया क्योंकि आर्ट फ्लो एआई से जो वीडियो जनरेट होती है ज्यादातर उनमें यही एनिमेशन अप्लाई होती है। आपको अपनी वीडियो स्टोरी के अकॉर्डिंग कोई इफेक्ट्स वगैरह लगाने की जरूरत महसूस होती है। तो आप इफेक्ट्स का भी इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं। ट्रांजिशन और इफेक्ट्स लगाने के बाद अब हम अपनी वीडियो में बैकग्राउंड म्यूजिक ऐड करेंगे। तो कॉपीराइट फ्री बैकग्राउंड म्यूजिक आप YouTube लाइब्रेरी से डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं। अब सब कुछ एडजस्ट करने के बाद अपनी वीडियो को एक्सपोर्ट कर लेंगे और अब अपनी वीडियो को प्ले करके देखते हैं। एक सुनहरी सुबह आर्यन अपने स्कूल के पिकनिक पर जंगल के पास गया था। तितली का पीछा करते-करते वह इतना दूर चला गया कि रास्ता ही भटक गया। पेड़ घने होते गए और चारों ओर अंधेरा सा छा गया। तभी ऊपर से एक आवाज आई। तुम तो लगते नहीं इस जंगल के हो बच्चू। आर्यन ने चौंक कर ऊपर देखा। एक तोता बोल रहा था। तुम कौन हो? आर्यन ने पूछा, नाम है कोको। इस जंगल में मैं पेड़ों से भी पुराना हूं। तोता अकड़ते हुए बोला और खुशकिस्मती है कि मैं अच्छा वाला तोता हूं। आर्यन ने उसे अपना साथी बना लिया और दोनों ने मिलकर जंगल की पगडंडियों पर सफर शुरू किया। उन्होंने कांटेदार झाड़ियों को पार किया। कीचड़ से भरी जगहें देखी और यहां तक कि एक सोते हुए सांप से भी बच निकले। आर्यन हर चुनौती के सामने डटा रहा। शाम होते-होते वो एक पेड़ के नीचे पहुंचे जहां ऊपर एक झोपड़ी बनी थी। अचानक एक लड़की नीचे कूदी। कौन हो तुम? और यहां क्या कर रहे हो? उसने लकड़ी की भाला उठाते हुए पूछा। मैं आर्यन हूं। रास्ता भटक गया हूं। आर्यन ने डर के बजाय हिम्मत से जवाब दिया। मैं रानी हूं। यहीं रहती हूं। आज तक कोई इतना अंदर नहीं आया। अब आपको वह वीडियो दिखाते हैं जो आर्ट फ्लो एआई ने इंग्लिश में क्रिएट की है। वन ब्राइट मॉर्निंगस प्ले बटरफाई लेफ्ट [संगीत] स्टार्टिलियरिंग एक्सप्लोरसव फियर ट हार्ट होप दर्गेदर

डिज़ वाला कितना बेहतरीन टूल क्रिएट किया जा सकता है जस्ट वन क्लिक में और यह चीज मैं आपको लाइव करके दिखाने वाला हूं तो अब आते हैं नेक्स्ट टॉपिक पे जो है इस वीडियो का एजेंडा तो दोस्तों यहां पे सबसे पहले हम फाइंड करेंगे वेब एप्स आईडिया जिस पे हम अपना वेब एप्लीकेशन क्रिएट कर सकते हैं दूसरा वेब एप्लीकेशन आईडिया को हम कन्वर्ट करेंगे एi प्र्प में यानी एक प्रोफेशनल प्र्ट उसको क्रिएट करके देखेंगे कैसे बनाते हैं एi की मदद से ही इसके अलावा उस प्र्प्ट्स को वन क्लिक में हम कैसे टूल बना सकते हैं इसको हम लाइव करके देखेंगे वेब एप्लीकेशनेशंस के लिए कंटेंट प्लान कैसे करते हैं यह कंप्लीट प्रोसेस हम सीखने वाले हैं यहां पर जो हम वेब एप्लीकेशन बना रहे हैं उसमें इनिशियल ट्रैफिक कैसे लाएंगे इसके क्या-क्या सोर्सर्सेस होंगे उस पे हम लर्न करने वाले हैं एडसेंस के लिए कब अप्लाई करना है कितने दिन बाद अप्लाई करना है इसके बारे में जानकारी शेयर करने वाला हूं और हम एक प्रो एडवांस मेथड जानने वाले हैं कि लाइक जब हमारा वेब एप्लीकेशन ल्च हो जाता है उस पर ट्रैफिक धीरे-धीरे ग्रो होता है लाइक 500 600 ट्रैफिक डेली का आने लगता है

हम बढ़ते हैं स्टेप्स की तरफ तो सबसे पहला स्टेप है जिसमें हम फाइंड करेंगे वेब टूल आइडियाज क्योंकि हमें पता होना चाहिए किस तरह के टूल्स हम बना रहे हैं राइट तो इसके लिए हम एआई का हेल्प ले सकते हैं उनसे टूल आईडिया फाइंड कर सकते हैं तो अब हम यहां पे लिखने वाले हैं हम कोई भी इंडस्ट्री नहीं देंगे तो यहां पे हम लिखेंगे भाई कि क्या करो सजेस्ट करो सजेस्ट 100्स प्लस वेब टू आइडियाज विद एंड विदाउट एआई एपीआई

है कई सारे वीडियो मैं बना चुका हूं नया वीडियो बनाने की जरूरत नहीं है इनिशियल ब्लॉक पे ट्रैफिक कैसे लाते हैं यह भी मैंने बताया है तो यह भी बताने की जरूरत नहीं है मुझे मैं बस यहां पे एग्जांपल दिखा रहा हूं तो वो भी आप चेक आउट कर सकते हैं डिस्क्रिप्शन में सारे लिंक मिल जाएंगे चैनल का नाम है शैलेश चौधरी आपको YouTube पे सर्च करोगे चैनल मिल जाएगा आप यहां पे जाके वीडियो चेक करोगे एक से एक कमाल के वीडियो

पहला तरीका ये हो गया अब दूसरा तरीका क्या है अब इसी पे जो कंटेंट है यहां पे अब यहां पे हम क्या कर सकते हैं इसी कंटेंट को ना हम सोशल मीडिया पे भी शेयर कर सकते हैं तो जैसे यह कंटेंट है facebook पे जाना है और ऐसे ग्रुप्स फाइंड करने हैं ना जहां पे पोस्ट शेयर कर सकें तो यहां पे जब आप एंटर करोगे लाइक यहां पे सर्च करोगे शेयर पोस्ट ठीक है और यहां पे आप आ जाओगे ग्रुप यहां पे ग्रुप्स पे तो देखेंगे बहुत सारे ऐसे ग्रुप्स मिलेंगे जहां पे पोस्ट शेयर कर सकते हैं यहां पे फॉलोअ भी अच्छे खासे अनलिमिटेड रील्स शेयर अनलिमिटेड पोस्ट शेयर ठीक है और 10 के मेंबर्स हैं इस पे इस पे देखेंगे 12 के मेंबर्स हैं तो यहां पे आप कुछ भी शेयर कर सकते हैं और यहां पे जैसे इससे जुड़ जाएंगे आप जुड़ जुड़ने के बाद आप यहां पे जाके अपने कंटेंट को जैसे यहां पे शेयर पोस्ट ओपन करते हैं अपने पोस्ट को सेलेक्ट करते हैं और यहां पे इसको एंटर कर देंगे एंटर करने के बाद आपका जो लिंक रहे लिंक जो आपके उसका रहे उसका लिंक यहां पे यहां पे इस तरह से जो लिंक रहे उसको लिंक एंटर करके यहां पर पोस्ट पर क्लिक कर सकते हैं तो यहां से भी जो भी यहां पर जो लोग होते हैं देखेंगे यहां पर पब्लिश हो गया इस तरह से लिंक ऐड हो गया है हमने जो पब्लिश किया है पब्लिश हो गया तो यहां पे जो मेंबर्स होंगे ना इनके साथ जाएगा और इनमें से जो भी इंटरेस्टेड होंगे वो शेयर करेंगे तो दो तरीका मैंने बता दिया तीसरा तरीका क्या है मीडियम जो है यहां पे आप फ्री आर्टिकल लिख सकते हैं इसी तरीके का Lindin है यहां पे आप फ्री आर्टिकल भी शेयर कर सकते हैं यानी ये आर्टिकल रैंक होते हैं काफी अच्छे तरीके से और यहां से भी आपको ट्रैफिक मिलेगा तो यह तरीका है इनिशियल ट्रैफिक लाने का अब बात करते हैं जब इनिशियल ट्रैफिक ला 500 400 आ जाएगा तो अब आप मोनेटाइज कब करेंगे देखेंगे मोनेटाइजेशन जैसा मैंने दिखाया कि YouTube थंबनेल डाउनलोडर पे भी मिलता है एडसेंस का और इस पे भी मिलता है तो इस पे जब आपके ट्रैफिक 100 200 आने लगे ऑर्गेनिक तब जाके मोनेटाइजेशन के लिए अप्लाई करें सारे प्रोसेस को स्टेप बाय स्टेप फॉलो करते आएंगे मान के चलिए 1 महीना 2 महीना यूज़ कर रहे हैं टूल को उसके बाद जाके आप मोनेटाइजेशन के लिए एडसेंस के लिए अप्लाई करेंगे तब अप्लाई होगा आपको फोकस करना है जो ट्रैफिक है 100 150 आने लगे तभी आपके चांसेस हैं अप्रूव होने का और यहां पे देखेंगे हमने एक लाइव दिखाया है कि हमने कैसे 5 मिनट के अंदर मोनेटाइजेशन लिया फर्स्ट डे से मोनेटाइजेशन के लिए ये वीडियो देख सकते हैं डिस्क्रिप्शन में लिंक है पहले दिन से मोनेटाइजेशन मिल जाएगा अब आपका मोनेटाइज भी हो गया अब आपको स्केल करना है तो स्केल करने के लिए आपको थोड़ा सा अपना पैसा खर्च करना पड़ेगा क्योंकि देखेंगे आप आपके पास दो ऑप्शन होते हैं या तो टाइम तो देखेंगे गेस्ट पोस्टिंग का आप गेस्ट पोस्टिंग कर सकते हो जो भी रिलेटेड हैं बिज़नेस वाले जो जैसे फॉर एग्जांपल ये टूल बना रहे हैं तो बिज़नेस वाले जो वेबसाइट है वहां पे गेस्ट पोस्टिंग कर सकते हैं इसके अलावा बहुत सारे पीआर सबमिशन वाले वेबसाइट होते हैं जैसे कि पेड आप सर्च करेंगे पेड गेस्ट पोस्टिंग ठीक है या फिर यहां पे पेड बेस्ट पोस्टिंग सर्विज सर्च करेंगे ठीक है यहां पे आपको देखेंगे जो ब्रांड पुश अप है काफी पॉपुलर है आपको यहां पे मिल जाएंगे आपको Fiverr पे बहुत सारे लोग मिल जाते हैं जो कि लाइक कैश पोस्टिंग के लिए सर्विज देते हैं यहां पे आप जाएंगे तो देखेंगे 70DR वाले साइट पे ड फॉलो लिंक के साथ तो यहां पे जैसे ब्रांड पुश अप का मैंने बताया तो देखेंगे यह दुनिया के बड़े-बड़े न्यूज़ के साथ जैसे बिनेस insider हो गया MSN हो गया Fox 20 हो गया Yahoo Finance हो गया इन सबके साथ ये लोग जुड़े हुए हैं तो ये लोग बहुत ही कम प्राइस में आप देखेंगे यहां पे प्राइिंग क्या बात करें तो आप देखेंगे 195 यूएस डॉलर में ही ऑर्डर कर सकते हैं इसमें आपका टोटल न्यूज़ आउटलेट 200 लोगों तक जाएगा और यहां पे क्या साइटें रहेंगे भी वो भी जैसे कि आपको देखने को मिल जाएंगे तो यहां पे देखेंगे इंडियन प्रेस का जो है आपको प्रेस रिलीज़ मिल जाएगा यहां पर पीआर सर्विज ऐसे सर्च करेंगे सर्विज तो आपको यहां पर इंडिया के जो भी आप लाइक बिजनेस वालों को आप लोग देखते होंगे कट शेयर करते हैं कि भाई मेरा इस न्यूज़ में आ गया ये सब ये सब ये पेड पीआर के थ्रू ही जाते हैं ज्यादातर लोग यहां पे आपको देखेंगे जैसे NS 18 NDTV जी N न्यूज़ Hindstan टाइम्स सारे में सारे में आप पब्लिश कर सकते हैं पीआर के थ्रू आप जाके सारे न्यूज़ जगह पे आपके बिज़नेस का नाम होगा तो इसके लिए पैसा खर्च करना पड़ता है और यह एक पैकेज देते हैं कि इस पैकेज के अंदर आपका जो है आप के किन-किन साइटों पे जाएगा तो आप जब बात करेंगे तो आप उनसे डिटेल में आपको मिल जाएगा तो इस तरीके से आप क्या है बूस्ट कर सकते हैं ये मेथोडोलॉजी बहुत ही वर्किंग है जल्दी से किसी ब्रांड को स्केल करना है तो यह बहुत ही तगड़ा तरीका है लेकिन इसमें पैसा लगता है जैसा मैंने बताया दूसरा तरीका है गेस्ट पोस्टिंग में आप जा सकते हैं ऑलरेडी मैं वीडियो बना चुका हूं तो उसको फॉलो कर सकते हैं लंबे समय तक काम कर सकते हैं तो अब जो मेरा होराइजन टूल के प्रति है देखिए होरजन टूल जो है होस्टिंगर ने बनाया है यह एक नो कोड डेवलपमेंट टूल है जो कि हेल्प करेगा क्रिएटर ब्लॉगर फ्रीलांसर या फिर कोई भी इंडिविजुअल जो कि विदाउट कोडिंग अपना टूल क्रिएट करना चाहते हैं होस्टिंगर पे जस्ट जस्ट एक कमांड देके जस्ट एक कीवर्ड देके उसके अराउंड टूल वेव बना सकते हैं कॉम्प्लेक्स टूल भी ये डिजाइन करता है छोटे टूल भी डिजाइन करता है काफी कमाल के इंटरफ़ेस के साथ यह टूल बनाता है और उसको डायरेक्टली हम अपने होस्टिंग पर डोमेन कनेक्ट करके लाइव कर सकते हैं तो यह प्रोसेस काफी स्मूथ है और काफी इजी है तो होप आप सभी को समझ में आया हो कोई भी सवाल है कोई भी प्रकार का अगर टूल हेल्प चाहिए तो हम हेल्प करेंगे बस इसके लिए आपको नीचे डिस्क्रिप्शन से दिए गए लिंक से होस्टिंग बाय करना है और उसका जो लाइक वो है क्या कहते हैं जो इनवॉइस है हमें

भाई लिटरली इतना खतरनाक तो आज का आप सेलेक्ट करेंगे मैं यहां पे आपको दिखाता हूं Google पे सर्च करके वेब एप्लीकेशनेशंस टूल का सबसे बड़ा जो बेनिफिट होता है यहां पर Google अपडेट्स के बहुत ज्यादा इंपैक्ट देखने को नहीं मिलते हैं चाहे वह Google कोर अपडेट हो या Google स्पैम अपडेट इसका मैं आपको एग्जांपल दिखाना चाहूं तो यह देख सकते हैं मेरे एक टूल का पिछले 12 महीने का ट्रैफिक रिपोर्ट है जिसमें आप देखेंगे कि आपको बहुत ज्यादा चेंजेस नहीं देखने को मिलता है अब इसका क्या कारण है इसका सबसे बड़ा जो कारण है वह आपको मैं वीडियो के लास्ट में मैं बताऊंगा लेकिन उससे पहले एक और बेनिफिट की बात कर लेते हैं वेब एप्लीकेशनेशंस में बिना ज्यादा कंटेंट लिखे भी हमें एडसेंस अप्रूवल काफी फास्ट मिल जाता है तो यह दो मेजर बेनिफिट्स हैं इसके अलावा भी बहुत सारे हैं मैं आपको आज जो बताने वाला हूं वो शायद आपको हैरान कर दे अभी तक मैंने बहुत सारे एi टूल्स की मदद से क्रिएट करने को बताया है कि कैसे हम कोड लिखते हैं और फिर वेब एप्लीकेशन क्रिएट करते हैं लेकिन आज मैं बताने वाला हूं कि केवल एक क्लिक में आपको किसी भी एआई टूल से कोड लिखने की जरूरत नहीं है इंप्लीमेंटेशन करने की जरूरत नहीं है जस्ट वन क्लिक में आप अपना वेब एप्लीकेशन या वेब ऐप बना सकते हैं जी हां यह बिल्कुल सच है मैं आपको डेमो दिखाता हूं यहां पर मैंने दो टूल बनाए हैं जो पहला टूल है यहां पर देखेंगे जो पहला टूल मैंने बनाया है यह एक इमेज कंप्रेसर है यहां पे कोई भी इमेज हम अपलोड करेंगे उसका साइज कंप्रेस कर देगा यह किस तरह के फॉर्मेट को सपोर्ट करता है यह jpgpn.gi का सपोर्ट करता है और यह मैक्सिमम 10 MB की फाइल को कंप्रेस कर सकता है अब यहां पे मैं आपको डेमो दिखा देता हूं यहां पे मैं फाइल सेलेक्ट करता हूं और जैसे यहां पर मैं एक पीएजी फाइल सेलेक्ट करता हूं आप देखेंगे और इसका जो साइज है यहां पर दिखा दिया 1.33 MB का है और यह प्रीव्यू करके दिखा रहा है क्वालिटी जो हमें कंप्रेस करना है हम इसको कम या ज्यादा भी कर सकते हैं और यहां पे कंप्रेस इमेज पे जब मैं क्लिक करता हूं तो देखेंगे यह 1.33 MB इमेज को कंप्रेस करके 134 KB का बना दिया तो काफी कमाल का टूल है ये और यहां पे हम जस्ट वन क्लिक में इसको डाउनलोड भी कर सकते हैं देखेंगे यह डाउनलोड हो गया है तो यह एक टूल है और सेकंड जो टूल हमने बनाया है अभी देखेंगे ये प्रीव्यू मोड में भी आपको दिख रहा होगा यह बना हुआ है इसमें आप देखेंगे इसने रेवेन्यू बताया इतना हुआ है प्रॉफिट इतना हुआ है आरओx इतना हुआ है ऐड स्पेंड इतना

जा सकता है तो ये दो टूल मैंने बनाया है एक मैंने इजी वाला टूल दिखाया वेब कंप्रेशन और एक मैंने दिखाया आपको कॉम्प्लेक्स टूल तो डेमो आपने देख लिया कितना फ्रेश डिज़ वाला कितना बेहतरीन टूल क्रिएट किया जा सकता है जस्ट वन क्लिक में और यह चीज मैं आपको लाइव करके दिखाने वाला हूं तो अब आते हैं नेक्स्ट टॉपिक पे जो है इस वीडियो का एजेंडा तो दोस्तों यहां पे सबसे पहले हम फाइंड करेंगे वेब एप्स आईडिया जिस पे हम

यानी उसको बूस्ट कैसे करेंगे यह जानने वाले हैं तो यह कंप्लीट वीडियो का एजेंडा है आर यू रेडी अगर यस तो वीडियो को लाइक करिए और अपने WhatsApp स्टेटस पर शेयर कर दीजिए और अब हम बढ़ते हैं स्टेप्स की तरफ तो सबसे पहला स्टेप है जिसमें हम फाइंड करेंगे वेब टूल आइडियाज क्योंकि हमें पता होना चाहिए कि इस तरह के टूल्स हम बना रहे हैं राइट तो इसके लिए हम एआई का हेल्प ले सकते हैं उनसे टूल आईडिया फाइंड कर सकते हैं

चाहिए इस टूल को यूज़ करने के लिए नहीं तो इस टूल को क्रिएट करके इस्तेमाल में नहीं लाया जा सकता है ठीक है तो ये आप समझ गए जो एआई पाउंड वाले हैं दूसरा जो इसने टूल आईडिया हमें जनरेट करके दिया है ये है नॉन एi मतलब इसमें हमें एआई एपीआई की जरूरत नहीं होगी जैसे साइट मैप जनरेटर हो गया सेम एसइओ एंड ब्लॉगिंग के लिए फेब आइकॉन जनरेटर हो गया फ्री वेबसाइट स्पीड टेस्ट टूल हो गया ठीक है google सर् सिमुलेटर हो गया फ्री वेबसाइट अप टाइम मॉनिटर हो गया ठीक है इसके बाद यहां पे क्या है डिजाइन एंड क्रिएटिव टूल्स में हो गया ऑनलाइन कलर पिककर हो गया ठीक है पीएजी टू जेपीजी कन्व्टर हो गया ठीक है 3d टेक्स्ट जनरेटर हो गया

दूंगा डिस्क्रिप्शन में फिर से बोल रहा हूं इसमें से कोई भी एक लिस्ट टूल सेलेक्ट कर सकते हैं स्टेप नंबर टू में हम सेलेक्ट करते हैं टूल आईडिया और उसको कन्वर्ट करेंगे एक ए प्र्ट में तो यहां पर हम क्या करते हैं सबसे पहले एक डॉक्स ओपन कर लेते हैं डॉक्स में क्योंकि हमारा डेटा सेव रहेगा फ्यूचर में अगर कोई चेंज होता है तो हम लाइक उसका हिस्ट्री चेक कर सकते हैं ठीक है तो यहां पे हम नाम देते हैं वेब वेब एप्स ठीक है तो यहां पे टूल आइडियाज हम लिखते हैं हैं तो यहां पे जो मैं एक छोटा और एक बड़ा दो टूल सेलेक्ट करूंगा और दोनों को बनाकर दिखाऊंगा तो इससे आपको आईडिया हो जाएगा कि कितना आसान प्रोसेस है तो यहां पे हम क्या करते हैं एआई एपीआई वाला नहीं करते हैं क्योंकि अगर यह एपीआई का करेंगे तो वो फिर हो सकता है आप जब टेस्ट करें काम ना करें तो यहां पर हम क्या करते हैं वीडियो में जाते हैं मैंने एक यहां पे कॉपी किया था YouTube थंबनेल डाउनलोडर यह क्यों आपको मैं दिखाना चाहूंगा मैंने YouTube थंबनेल डाउनलोडर क्यों सेलेक्ट किया है इसका जो यहां पे देखेंगे एडसेंस अप्रूवल मिलता है youtube डाउनलोडर पे नहीं मिलता है लेकिन इस पे एडसेंस अप्रूवल मिलता है और इस पे ह्यूज ट्रैफिक है देखेंगे जो मंथली सर्चेज है ना एवरेज वह 400 429000 है और यहां पे हर एक बंदा लगभग डेढ़ पेज विजिट करता है तो मतलब आप समझ के चलिए कि लाइक जो अर्निंग है वह काफी हाई है थंबनेल डाउनलोडर पे जो सीपीसी है वह भी काफी हाई है 1.2 का है जो कि काफी अच्छा है ट्रैफिक देखेंगे यूनाइटेड स्टेट से 15% है इंडिया पाकिस्तान यह तीन ट्रैफिक सोर्सेस है इनका जहां से कमाई भी अच्छी होगी तो इसका कारण है तो यहां पे यह स्माल टूल के कैटेगरी में आएगा स्माल टूल के कैटेगरी में आएगा ठीक है और हम एक बनाएंगे एक टूल और क्रिएट करके देखेंगे एक लास्ट टूल भी क्रिएट करेंगे तो यहां पे अनटप्ड कैटेगरी जो हमने फाइंड किया था वो तो यहां पे देखेंगे कोई भी हम सेलेक्ट करेंगे एसइओ आते हैं डिज़ में तो यहां पे मल्टी फॉर्मेट इमेज एनालाइजर है ठीक है यहां पे देखेंगे एक हमें बहुत ही कमाल

हैं ठीक है हम यहां पे Google सर्च करते हैं तो Google का डिज़ाइन कुछ इस तरह से दिखता है bing सर्च करते हैं तो Bing का डिज़ाइन कुछ इस तरह से दिखता है इन्होंने इस तरीके से बनाया है और Google ने इस तरीके से

इसको बताने की जरूरत नहीं है देखेंगे इसने हमें कई सारे कम से कम 10 तो बताएगा ही लग रहा है मुझे मानेगा नहीं यह सेकंड वाले को सेलेक्ट करने के बाद अब हमें क्या करना है यहां पे एक और एi टूल यूज़ करना है जिसका नाम है क्वi क्वन AI से हम क्या कर सकते हैं अपना जो है AI से इमेज जनरेट कर सकते हैं अपने प्रिंटst के लिए अब हम क्या करेंगे यहां पे क्रिएट इमेज ऑप्शन पे हम सेलेक्ट करेंगे साइज़ में जाएंगे साइज़ हम सेलेक्ट करेंगे लाइक अ 3:4 वाला सेक्शन और इसके बाद यहां पे जाएंगे क्रिएट एन इमेज फॉर Pट यहां पे डिफाइन कर देना है पिन ऑन टॉपिक ठीक है ताकि सब चीज सही से क्रिएट हो यहां पर हम एंटर करेंगे ठीक है यह इस तरीके से अब यह थोड़ा सा टाइम लेगा और हमें क्रिएट करके दे देगा ठीक है इमेज हमारा बना देगा तो देखेंगे इसने इस तरीके से इमेज बना दिया है और हम क्या कर सकते हैं इस इमेज को डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं डाउनलोड करने के बाद अब हम क्या करेंगे यहां पर आएंगे और यहां पर इसको देंगे राइट राइट pinst पिन कंटेंट ठीक है पिन कंटेंट और ऑन टॉपिक ठीक है यह टॉपिक हम इसको पकड़ा देंगे अब ये पिन का पूरा कंटेंट बना देगा ठीक है अब देखेंगे दो कंटेंट ये बना रहा है अब हम क्या करेंगे नेक्स्ट स्टेप में आएंगे नेक्स्ट स्टेप में आने के बाद हम क्या करेंगे pinterest पे जाएंगे pinterest पे ऑलरेडी मेरा अकाउंट है कैसे बनाना है कई सारे वीडियो मैं बना चुका हूं नया वीडियो बनाने की जरूरत नहीं है इनिशियल ब्लॉक पे ट्रैफिक कैसे लाते हैं यह भी मैंने बताया है तो यह भी बताने की जरूरत नहीं है मुझे मैं बस यहां पे एग्जांपल दिखा रहा हूं तो वो भी आप चेक आउट कर सकते हैं डिस्क्रिप्शन में सारे लिंक मिल जाएंगे चैनल का नाम है शैलेश चौधरी आपको YouTube पे सर्च करोगे चैनल मिल जाएगा आप यहां पे जाके वीडियो चेक करोगे एक से एक कमाल के वीडियो यहां पे आपको मिलेंगे हम क्या करते हैं यहां पे जाएंगे क्रिएट ऑर्गेनिक ऑप्शन में क्रिएट पिन यहां पे क्लिक करते हैं इमेज को हम अपलोड करेंगे अपलोड करने के बाद हम आ जाएंगे यहां पे देखेंगे इसने बनाया है टाइटल और यहां पे इस टाइटल को हम लोग क्या करते हैं यहां पे टाइटल पेस्ट करेंगे टाइटल पेस्ट करने के बाद हम क्या करेंगे यहां पे जो भी ये है डिस्क्रिप्शन यहां पे कॉपी करते हैं और यहां पे ये डिस्क्रिप्शन है यहां पे इसे पेस्ट कर देंगे ठीक है यहां पे इसको हम कर देंगे पेस्ट और यहां पे बोर्ड सेलेक्ट करके हम यहां पे हमने बोर्ड सेलेक्ट कर लिया अब यहां पे हम पब्लिश पे क्लिक कर देंगे तो यह हमारा इस तरह से हमारा पिन हो जाएगा पब्लिश कुछ पिन पब्लिश करेंगे तो यहां पे जो भी है हमारे यहां पे क्लिक करके हमारी वेबसाइट तक विजिट कर सकता है और इस तरह से पिन बनाते जाएंगे फिर धीरे-धीरे हमें यहां से ट्रैफिक मिलता जाएगा तो पहला तरीका ये हो गया अब दूसरा तरीका क्या है अब इसी पे जो कंटेंट है यहां पे अब यहां पे हम क्या कर सकते हैं इसी कंटेंट को ना हम सोशल मीडिया पे भी शेयर कर सकते हैं तो जैसे ये कंटेंट है facebook पे जाना है और ऐसे ग्रुप्स फाइंड करने हैं ना जहां पे पोस्ट शेयर कर सकें तो यहां पे जब आप एंटर करोगे लाइक अ यहां पे सर्च करोगे शेयर पोस्ट ठीक है और यहां पे आप आ जाओगे ग्रुप यहां पे ग्रुप्स पे तो देखेंगे बहुत सारे ऐसे ग्रुप्स मिलेंगे जहां पे पोस्ट शेयर कर सकते हैं यहां पे फॉलोवर भी अच्छे खासे अनलिमिटेड रेल शेयर अनलिमिटेड पोस्ट शेयर ठीक है और 10 के मेंबर्स हैं इस पे इस पे देखेंगे 12 के मेंबर्स हैं तो यहां पे आप कुछ भी शेयर कर सकते हैं और यहां पे जैसे इससे जुड़ जाएंगे आप जुड़ जुड़ने के बाद आप यहां वहां पे जाके अपने कंटेंट को जैसे यहां पे शेयर पोस्ट ओपन करते हैं अपने पोस्ट को सेलेक्ट करते हैं और यहां पे इसको एंटर कर देंगे एंटर करने के बाद आपका जो लिंक रहे लिंक जो आपके उसका रहे उसका लिंक यहां पे यहां पे इस तरह से जो लिंक रहे उसको लिंक एंटर करके यहां पे पोस्ट पे क्लिक कर सकते हैं तो यहां से भी जो भी यहां पे जो लोग होते हैं देखेंगे यहां पे पब्लिश हो गया इस तरह से लिंक ऐड हो गया है हमने जो पब्लिश किया है पब्लिश हो गया तो यहां पे जो मेंबर्स होंगे ना इनके साथ जाएगा और इनमें से जो भी इंटरेस्टेड होंगे वो शेयर करेंगे तो दो तरीका मैंने बता दिया तीसरा तरीका क्या है मीडियम जो है यहां पे आप फ्री आर्टिकल लिख सकते हैं इसी तरीके का Lindin है यहां पे आप फ्री आर्टिकल भी शेयर कर सकते हैं यानी ये आर्टिकल रैंक होते हैं काफी अच्छे तरीके से और यहां से भी आपको ट्रैफिक मिलेगा तो ये तरीका है इनिशियल ट्रैफिक लाने का अब बात करते हैं जब इनिशियल ट्रैफिक 500 400 आ जाएगा तो अब आप मोनेटाइज कब करेंगे देखेंगे मोनेटाइजेशन जैसा मैंने दिखाया कि YouTube थंबनेल डाउनलोडर पे भी मिलता है एडसेंस का और इस पे भी मिलता है तो इस पे जब आपके ट्रैफिक 100 200 आने लगे ऑर्गेनिक तब जाके मोनेटाइजेशन के लिए अप्लाई करें सारे प्रोसेस को स्टेप बाय स्टेप फॉलो करते आएंगे मान के चलिए 1 महीना 2 महीना यूज़ कर रहे हैं टूल को उसके बाद जाके आप मोनेटाइजेशन के लिए एडसेंस के लिए अप्लाई करेंगे तब अप्लाई होगा आपको फोकस करना है जो ट्रैफिक है 100 150 आने लगे तभी आपके चांसेस हैं अप्रूव होने का और यहां पे देखेंगे हमने एक लाइव दिखाया है कि हमने कैसे 5 मिनट के अंदर मोनेटाइजेशन लिया फर्स्ट डे से मोनेटाइजेशन के लिए यह वीडियो देख सकते हैं डिस्क्रिप्शन में लिंक है पहले दिन से मोनेटाइजेशन मिल जाएगा अब आपका मोनेटाइज भी हो गया अब आपको स्केल करना है तो स्केल करने के लिए आपको थोड़ा सा अपना पैसा खर्च करना पड़ेगा क्योंकि देखेंगे आप के पास दो ऑप्शन होते हैं या तो टाइम तो देखेंगे गेस्ट पोस्टिंग का आप गेस्ट पोस्टिंग कर सकते हो जो भी रिलेटेड हैं बिजनेस वाले जो जैसे फॉर एग्जांपल ये टूल बना रहे हैं तो बिज़नेस वाले जो वेबसाइट है वहां पे गेस्ट पोस्टिंग कर सकते हैं इसके अलावा बहुत सारे पीआर सबमिशन वाले वेबसाइट होते हैं जैसे कि पेड आप सर्च करेंगे पेड गेस्ट पोस्टिंग ठीक है या फिर यहां पे पेड बेस्ट पोस्टिंग सर्विज सर्च करेंगे ठीक है यहां पे आपको देखेंगे जो ब्रांड पुश अप है काफी पॉपुलर है आपको यहां पे मिल जाएंगे आपको Fiverr पे बहुत सारे लोग मिल जाते हैं जो कि लाइक कैश पोस्टिंग के लिए सर्विज देते हैं यहां पे आप जाएंगे तो देखेंगे 70DR वाले साइट पे ड फॉलो लिंक के साथ तो यहां पे जैसे ब्रांड पुश अप का मैंने बताया तो देखेंगे यह दुनिया के बड़े-बड़े न्यूज़ के साथ जैसे बिज़नेस insider हो गया MSN हो गया Fox 20 हो गया अह Yahoo Finance हो गया इन सबके साथ ये लोग जुड़े हुए हैं तो ये लोग बहुत ही कम प्राइस में आप देखेंगे यहां पे प्राइिंग का बात करें तो आप देखेंगे 195 यूएस डॉलर में ही ऑर्डर कर सकते हैं इसमें आपका टोटल न्यूज़ आउटलेट 200 लोगों तक जाएगा और यहां पे क्या साइटें रहेंगे भी वो भी जैसे कि आपको देखने को मिल जाएंगे तो यहां पे देखेंगे इंडियन प्रेस का जो है आपको प्रेस रिलीज़ मिल जाएगा यहां पर पीआर सर्विज ऐसे सर्च करेंगे सर्विसेस तो आपको यहां पर इंडिया के जो भी आप लाइक बिजनेस वालों को आप लोग देखते होंगे कट शेयर करते हैं कि भाई मेरा इस न्यूज़ में आ गया ये सब ये सब ये पेड पीआर के थ्रू ही जाते हैं ज्यादातर लोग यहां पे आपको देखेंगे जैसे न्यूज़ 18 NDTV जी न्यूज़ हिंदुस्तान टाइम सारे में सारे में आप पब्लिश कर सकते हैं पीआर के थ्रू आप जाके सारे न्यूज़ जगह पे आपके बिज़नेस का नाम होगा तो इसके लिए पैसा खर्च करना पड़ता है और यह एक पैकेज देते हैं कि इस पैकेज के अंदर आपका जो है आप किन-किन साइटों पर जाएगा तो आप जब बात करेंगे तो आप उनसे डिटेल में आपको मिल जाएगा तो इस तरीके से आप क्या है बूस्ट कर सकते हैं ये मेथोडोलॉजी बहुत ही वर्किंग है जल्दी से किसी ब्रांड को स्केल करना है तो यह बहुत ही तगड़ा तरीका है लेकिन इसमें पैसा लगता है जैसा मैंने बताया दूसरा तरीका है गेस्ट पोस्टिंग में आप जा सकते हैं ऑलरेडी मैं वीडियो बना चुका हूं तो उसको फॉलो कर सकते हैं लंबे समय तक काम कर सकते हैं तो अब जो मेरा होराइजन टूल के प्रति है देखिए होरजन टूल जो है होस्टिंगर ने बनाया है यह एक नो कोड डेवलपमेंट टूल है जो कि हेल्प करेगा क्रिएटर ब्लॉगर फ्रीलांसर या फिर कोई भी इंडिविजुअल जो कि विदाउट कोडिंग अपना टूल क्रिएट करना चाहते हैं होस्टिंगर पे जस्ट जस्ट एक कमांड देके जस्ट एक कीवर्ड देके उसके अराउंड टूल वे बना सकते हैं कॉम्प्लेक्स टूल भी ये डिजाइन करता है छोटे टूल भी डिजाइन करता है काफी कमाल के इंटरफ़ेस के साथ यह टूल बनाता है और उसको डायरेक्टली हम अपने होस्टिंग पर डोमेन कनेक्ट करके लाइव कर सकते हैं तो यह प्रोसेस काफी स्मूथ है और काफी इजी है तो होप आप सभी को समझ में आया हो कोई भी सवाल है कोई भी प्रकार का अगर टूल हेल्प चाहिए तो हम हेल्प करेंगे बस इसके लिए आपको नीचे डिस्क्रिप्शन से दिए गए लिंक से होस्टिंग बाय करना है और उसका जो लाइक वो है क्या कहते हैं जो इनवॉइस है हमें ईमेल करना है ईमेल आपको डिस्क्रिप्शन में मिल जाएगा और इसी के साथ इस चैनल पे हमें सब्सक्राइब करके भी जाइएगा मिलते हैं नेक्स्ट वीडियो में तब तक के लिए आप सभी का धन्य केवल एक क्लिक में आपको किसी भी एआई टूल से कोड लिखने की जरूरत नहीं है इंप्लीमेंटेशन करने की जरूरत नहीं है जस्ट वन क्लिक में आप अपना वेब एप्लीकेशन या वेब ऐप बना सकते हैं वेलकम टू द बैंग भाई कितना खतरनाक बना दिया भाई कसम से कह रहा हूं मैं भाई लिटरली इतना खतरनाक तो आज का आप सेलेक्ट करेंगे मैं यहां पे आपको दिखाता हूं Google पे सर्च करके वेब एप्लीकेशनेशंस टूल का सबसे बड़ा जो बेनिफिट होता है यहां पर Google अपडेट्स के बहुत ज्यादा इंपैक्ट देखने को नहीं मिलते हैं चाहे वो Google कोर अपडेट हो या Google स्पैम अपडेट इसका मैं आपको एग्जांपल दिखाना चाहूं तो यह देख सकते हैं मेरे एक टूल का पिछले 12 महीने का ट्रैफिक रिपोर्ट है जिसमें आप देखेंगे कि आपको बहुत ज्यादा चेंजेस नहीं देखने को मिलता है अब इसका क्या कारण है इसका सबसे बड़ा जो कारण है वह आपको मैं वीडियो के लास्ट में मैं बताऊंगा लेकिन उससे पहले एक और बेनिफिट की बात कर लेते हैं वेब एप्लीकेशनेशंस में बिना ज्यादा कंटेंट लिखे भी हमें एडसेंस अप्रूवल काफी फास्ट मिल जाता है तो यह दो मेजर बेनिफिट्स हैं इसके अलावा भी बहुत सारे हैं मैं आपको आज जो बताने वाला हूं वो शायद आपको हैरान कर दे अभी तक मैंने बहुत सारे एआई टूल्स की मदद से क्रिएट करने को बताया है कि कैसे हम कोड लिखते हैं और फिर वेब एप्लीकेशन क्रिएट करते हैं लेकिन आज मैं बताने वाला हूं कि केवल एक क्लिक में आपको किसी भी एआई टूल से कोड लिखने की जरूरत नहीं है इंप्लीमेंटेशन करने की जरूरत नहीं है जस्ट वन क्लिक में आप अपना वेब एप्लीकेशन या वेब ऐप बना सकते हैं जी हां यह बिल्कुल सच है मैं आपको डेमो दिखाता हूं यहां पर मैंने दो टूल बनाए हैं जो पहला टूल है यहां पर देखेंगे जो पहला टूल मैंने बनाया है यह एक इमेज कंप्रेसर है यहां पे कोई भी इमेज हम अपलोड करेंगे उसका साइज कंप्रेस कर देगा यह किस तरह के फॉर्मेट को सपोर्ट करता है यह jpgpn.gi का सपोर्ट करता है और यह मैक्सिमम 10 MB की फाइल को कंप्रेस कर सकता है अब यहां पे मैं आपको डेमो दिखा देता हूं यहां पे मैं फाइल सेलेक्ट करता हूं और जैसे यहां पर मैं एक पीएजी फाइल सेलेक्ट करता हूं आप देखेंगे और इसका जो साइज है यहां पर दिखा दिया 1.33 MB का है और यह प्रीव्यू करके दिखा रहा है क्वालिटी जो हमें कंप्रेस करना है हम इसको कम या ज्यादा भी कर सकते हैं और यहां पे कंप्रेस इमेज पे जब मैं क्लिक करता हूं तो देखेंगे यह 1.33 MB इमेज को कंप्रेस करके 134 KB का बना दिया तो काफी कमाल का टूल है ये और यहां पे हम जस्ट वन क्लिक में इसको डाउनलोड भी कर सकते हैं देखेंगे ये डाउनलोड हो गया है तो यह एक टूल है और सेकंड जो टूल हमने बनाया है अभी देखेंगे ये प्रीव्यू मोड में भी आपको दिख रहा होगा बना हुआ है इसमें आप देखेंगे इसने रेवेन्यू बताया इतना हुआ है प्रॉफिट इतना हुआ है आरओx इतना हुआ है ऐड स्पेंड इतना हुआ है और यहां पे एआई इनसाइड भी है कितना प्रॉफिट मार्जिन हुआ है ये सब कैलकुलेट करके यह बता रहा था तो देखेंगे ये कितना कॉम्प्लेक्स टूल है जिसको हमने बनाया है जस्ट वन क्लिक में और इसमें पूरा इंसाइट आपको देखने को मिलेगा और यह पूरा काम कर रहा है आसानी के साथ यहां पे फॉरकास्ट भी आप चेक कर सकते हैं कि फ्यूचर में क्या होने वाला है इवन ग्राफ भी यह ड्र्रा कर देता है और यहां पे नीचे देखेंगे Amazon एड्स पे कितना हुआ है Google एड्स पे कितना हुआ है TikTok एड्स पे सब सब यहां पे आपको देखने को मिल रहा है यहां पे ऑप्शन भी मिलता है लाइट मोड का डार्क मोड का और उसके बाद यहां पे की मैट्रिसेस भी देखने को मिल जाते हैं इसके अलावा यहां पे अपलोड करके कोई फाइल अगर आपको समझ में नहीं आ रहा है तो यहां पे सैंपल डेटा का भी इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं और यहां पे कोई भी डेटा जो कि इस फॉर्मेट में हो उसको अपलोड करके एनालिसिस किया जा सकता है तो ये दो टूल मैंने बनाया है एक मैंने इजी वाला टूल दिखाया वेब कंप्रेशन और एक मैंने दिखाया आपको कॉम्प्लेक्स टूल तो डेमो आपने देख लिया कितना फ्रेश डिज़ाइन वाला कितना बेहतरीन टूल क्रिएट किया जा सकता है जस्ट वन क्लिक में और यह चीज मैं आपको लाइव करके दिखाने वाला हूं तो अब आते हैं नेक्स्ट टॉपिक पे जो है इस वीडियो का एजेंडा तो दोस्तों यहां पे सबसे पहले हम फाइंड करेंगे वेब एप्स आईडिया जिस पे हम अपना वेब एप्लीकेशन क्रिएट कर सकते हैं दूसरा वेब एप्लीकेशन आईडिया को हम कन्वर्ट करेंगे एi प्र्प में यानी एक प्रोफेशनल प्र्ट उसको क्रिएट करके देखेंगे कैसे बनाते हैं एi की मदद से ही इसके अलावा उस प्र्प्ट को वन क्लिक में हम कैसे टूल बना सकते हैं इसको हम लाइव करके देखेंगे वेब एप्लीकेशनेशंस के लिए कंटेंट प्लान कैसे करते हैं यह कंप्लीट प्रोसेस हम सीखने वाले हैं यहां पर जो हम वेब एप्लीकेशन बना रहे हैं उसमें इनिशियल ट्रैफिक कैसे लाएंगे इसके क्या-क्या सोर्सर्सेस होंगे उस पे हम लर्न करने वाले हैं एडसेंस के लिए कब अप्लाई करना है कितने दिन बाद अप्लाई करना है इसके बारे में जानकारी शेयर करने वाला हूं और हम एक प्रो एडवांस मेथड जानने वाले हैं कि लाइक जब हमारा वेब एप्लीकेशन ल्च हो जाता है उस पर ट्रैफिक धीरे-धीरे ग्रो होता है लाइक 500 600 ट्रैफिक डेली का आने लगता है हम उसको स्काई रॉकेट कैसे करेंगे यानी उसको बूस्ट कैसे करेंगे यह जानने वाले हैं तो यह कंप्लीट वीडियो का एजेंडा है आर यू रेडी अगर यस तो वीडियो को लाइक करिए और अपने WhatsApp स्टेटस पर शेयर कर दीजिए और अब हम बढ़ते हैं स्टेप्स की तरफ तो सबसे पहला स्टेप है जिसमें हम फाइंड करेंगे वेब टूल आइडियाज क्योंकि हमें पता होना चाहिए कि इस तरह के टूल्स हम बना रहे हैं राइट तो इसके लिए हम एआई का हेल्प ले सकते हैं उनसे टूल आईडिया फाइंड कर सकते हैं तो अब हम यहां पे लिखने वाले हैं हम कोई भी इंडस्ट्री नहीं देंगे तो यहां पे हम लिखेंगे भाई कि क्या करो सजेस्ट करो सजेस्ट 100्स प्लस वेब टू आइडियाज विद एंड विदाउट एआई एपीआई ठीक है मैंने बस यहां पर सिंपल सा कुछ नहीं लिखा है मुझे कहा है गाइस 100 प्लस वेब टूल आईडिया सजेस्ट करो जिसमें एआई की भी जरूरत एआई एपीआई की भी जरूरत हो और उसके बिना मतलब एपीआई जरूरत हो और ना जरूरत हो दोनों तरह के टूल हमें चाहिए तो यहां पे एंटर हिट करते हैं इसका क्या बेनिफिट है मैं आपको आगे बताऊंगा बट अभी हम यहां पे इसको देखते हैं पहले इसने सबसे पहले एआई पावर टूल्स का लिस्ट बनाया है तो यहां पे देखेंगे 10 इसने बना दिया है 20 25 ये तो लिस्ट ही बनाता जा रहा है अब देखेंगे लास्ट में इसने बोला कि और चाहिए यूनिक अनटैब्ड अनटैब्ड हम सर्च करते हैं अनटैब्ड वेब टूल आइडियाज ठीक है ये जैसे अनटैब्ड मतलब जिस पे इसको लोगों ने काम नहीं किया हो ये सब चीजें तो इसको भी हम एंटर कर देते हैं यूनिक जो [संगीत] होगा अब मैं एक बार क्रिएट हो जाए फिर दिखाता हूं फिर आपको समझ में आएगा ये सारे मैं लिस्ट पूरा दे दूंगा डिस्क्रिप्शन में आप इनको डाउनलोड करके यूज़ कर सकते हैं आप या फिर सिंपल जैसा मैंने लिखा है वैसा टाइप करेंगे आपको मिल जाएगा कोई दिक्कत वाली बात नहीं है देखेंगे यहां पे मैं लाइव करके दिखाता हूं मैं बाद नहीं बता देता हूं चीजें जो मैं करता हूं वही मैं आपको दिखाता हूं यह चीज ध्यान रखना दोस्तों कि जो मैं कर रहा हूं वही मैं आपको दिखाता हूं या कह लीजिए कि जो मैं कर रहा हूं उसका 10% भी आपको दिखाता हूं उसका तो पूरा दिखाता भी नहीं यहां पे इसने ऐसे टूल्स के आईडिया जनरेट किए हैं जैसे एसइओ या ब्लॉगिंग इंडस्ट्री से रिलेटेड एआई कंटेंट रीाइटर रीडिबिलिटी स्कोर एनालाइजर एआई पावर ब्लॉग आउटलाइन क्रिएटर ठीक है डिज़ाइन में एi पावर लोगो जनरेटर एआई बेस्ड फ़ोटो एनहांसर यह कितने यहां पे देखेंगे एi पावर वाटरम्क रिमूवर एi अवतार क्रिएटर एi बेस्ड मेम क्रिएटर ठीक है तो यहां पे बहुत सारे एi पावर टूल आईडिया जनरेट किए हैं देखेंगे एi बेस्ड लिप सिंक टूल ठीक है एi बेस्ड बैकग्राउंड नॉइज़ रिमूवर एआई बेस्ड म्यूजिक जनरेटर ठीक है अब यहां पे देखेंगे कोडिंग से रिलेटेड भी है बिज़नेस से रिलेटेड भी है और ई-कॉमर्स से रिलेटेड भी है यह है एआई इसमें एi का इस्तेमाल होगा मतलब एi पावर्ड का मतलब सिंपल सा है इसमें एi की एपीआई यूज़ होगी जैसे कि ओपन एi की एपीआई हो गई google की एआई की एपीआई हो गई जैसे GK AI की एपीआई हो गई किसी ना किसी एआई की एपीआई जो है चाहिए इस टूल को यूज़ करने के लिए नहीं तो इस टूल को क्रिएट करके इस्तेमाल में नहीं लाया जा सकता है ठीक है तो ये आप समझ गए जो एi पाउंड वाले हैं दूसरा जो इसने टूल आईडिया हमें जनरेट करके दिया है ये है नॉन एi मतलब इसमें हमें एआई एपीआई की जरूरत नहीं होगी जैसे साइट मैप जनरेटर हो गया ए सेम एसइओ एंड ब्लॉगिंग के लिए फेब आइकॉन जनरेटर हो गया फ्री वेबसाइट स्पीड टेस्ट टूल हो गया ठीक है google सर् सिमुलेटर हो गया फ्री वेबसाइट अप टाइम

कोडिंग के लिए भी बताया है तो कोडिंग को स्किप कर रहा हूं मैं बिजनेस के लिए भी बताया है इसने ऑनलाइन टाइम ट्रैकर टूल हो गया एक्सपेंस ट्रैकर टूल हो गया फिर ऑनलाइन पोल मेकर टूल हो गया बिज़नेस कार्ड जनरेटर टूल हो गया इसके बाद ई-कॉमर्स के लिए फ्री शॉपिफाई प्रॉफ़िट कैलकुलेटर हो गया amazon फी कैलकुलेटर हो गया शॉपिफाई सेल्स टैक्स कैलकुलेटर हो गया ठीक है इसके बाद यहां पे देखेंगे हमने अनटप्ड वाले टॉपिक को भी दिया है तो यहां पे अनटैप्ड वाले टॉपिक में क्या है यहां पे कंपिटिट गैप फाइंडर हो गया कॉम्पिटिट कंटेंट गैप फाइंडर ठीक है यहां पे जो भी यह बहुत ही पॉपुलर बहुत ही पावरफुल वे है अपने ब्लॉग पे ट्रैफिक जनरेट करने का अपने ब्लॉग पे इंडेक्सिंग फास्ट करने का अपने ब्लॉग पे रैंकिंग फास्ट करने का कि जो हमारे कॉम्पिटिट हैं लाइक अ कोई भी नीज़ हम सेलेक्ट करते हैं जो उसके टॉप कॉम्पिटिटर्स हैं उन पे ऐसे कंटेंट को फाइंड करने के लिए जो उन्होंने कवर नहीं किया है यहां पे गैप एनालिसिस गैप फाइंडर के लिए यह टूल क्रिएट कर सकते हैं google सर्च इंटेंट क्लासिफायर हो गया ठीक है इसके बाद यहां पे जीरो क्लिक सर्च फाइंडर हो गया ठीक है अब यहां पे देखेंगे डिज़ में एi बेस्ड 3D लोगो क्रिएटर हो गया वीडियो में आएंगे एi बेस्ड पडकास्ट रिपर्पसर हो गया ठीक है स्लाइस साइलेंट वीडियो बैकग्राउंड म्यूजिक मैचर हो गया ठीक है तो यहां पे कितने तरीके के इसने टूल बना दिए हैं जिसका कोई लिस्ट नहीं है शॉपिफाई अबंडेंट कार्ड रिकवरी मैसेज जनरेटर हो गया तो इसमें से कोई भी एक टूल सेलेक्ट कर सकते हैं ये सारे लिस्ट मैं आपको दे दूंगा डिस्क्रिप्शन में फिर से बोल रहा हूं इसमें से कोई भी एक लिस्ट टूल सेलेक्ट कर सकते हैं स्टेप नंबर टू में हम सेलेक्ट करते हैं टूल आइडिया और उसको कन्वर्ट करेंगे एक एई प्र्प्ट में तो यहां पर हम क्या करते हैं सबसे पहले एक डॉक्स ओपन कर लेते हैं डॉक्स में क्योंकि हमारा डेटा सेव रहेगा फ्यूचर में अगर कोई चेंज होता है तो हम लाइक उसका हिस्ट्री चेक कर सकते हैं ठीक है तो यहां पे हम नाम देते हैं वेब वेब एप्स ठीक है तो यहां पे टूल आइडियाज हम लिखते हैं हैं तो यहां पर जो मैं एक छोटा और एक बड़ा दो टूल सेलेक्ट करूंगा और दोनों को बनाकर दिखाऊंगा तो इससे आपको आईडिया हो जाएगा कि कितना आसान प्रोसेस है तो यहां पे हम क्या करते हैं एआई एपीआई वाला नहीं करते हैं क्योंकि अगर एपीआई का करेंगे तो वो फिर हो सकता है आप जब टेस्ट करें काम ना करें तो यहां पर हम क्या करते हैं वीडियो में जाते हैं मैंने एक यहां पे कॉपी किया था YouTube थंबनेल डाउनलोडर यह क्यों आपको मैं दिखाना चाहूंगा मैंने YouTube थंबनेल डाउनलोडर क्यों सेलेक्ट किया है इसका जो यहां पे देखेंगे एडसेंस अप्रूवल मिलता है youtube डाउनलोडर पे नहीं मिलता है लेकिन इस पे एडसेंस अप्रूवल मिलता है और इस पे ह्यूज ट्रैफिक है देखेंगे जो मंथली सर्चेज है ना एवरेज वो 400 429000 है और यहां पे हर एक बंदा लगभग डेढ़ पेज विजिट करता है तो मतलब आप समझ के चलिए कि लाइक जो अर्निंग है वह काफी हाई है थंबनेल डाउनलोडर पे जो सीपीसी है वह भी काफी हाई है 1.2 का है जो कि काफी अच्छा है ट्रैफिक देखेंगे यूनाइटेड स्टेट से 15% है इंडिया पाकिस्तान यह तीन ट्रैफिक सोर्सर्सेस हैं इनका जहां से कमाई भी अच्छी होगी तो इसका कारण है तो यहां पे ये स्माल टूल के कैटेगरी में आएगा स्माल टूल के कैटेगरी में आएगा ठीक है और हम एक बनाएंगे एक टूल और क्रिएट करके देखेंगे एक लार्ज टूल भी क्रिएट करेंगे तो यहां पे अनटप्ड कैटेगरी जो हमने फाइंड किया था वो तो यहां पे देखेंगे कोई भी हम सेलेक्ट करेंगे एसइओ आते हैं डिज़ में तो यहां पर मल्टी फॉर्मेट इमेज एनालाइजर है ठीक है यहां पर देखेंगे एक हमें बहुत ही कमाल का एक आईडिया मिला है जो कि लाइक थोड़ा सा कॉम्प्लेक्स है डिजाइन में बट कमाल का है लाइक कई सारे लोग के लिए कई सारे यूज़र्स हैं जैसे कि आप मैं आपको एक इसका दिखाना चाहूंगा जैसे हम यहां पे Google सर्च करते हैं ठीक है हम यहां पर Google सर्च करते हैं तो Google का डिजाइन कुछ इस तरह से दिखता है bing सर्च करते हैं तो Bing का डिजाइन कुछ इस तरह से दिखता है इन्होंने इस तरीके से बनाया है और Google ने इस तरीके से बनाया है तो इसका कारण क्या है इसमें कलर जो है इनके लोगो में इनके लोगो में जो कलर है इन सबका एक कारण होता है तो जब भी कोई ब्रांड बिल्ड करता है ना तो उसमें लाइक किस तरह के फॉन्ट इस्तेमाल होते हैं क्या कलर स्कीम रहेगा लोगो का कलर कैसा होगा टेक्स्ट का कलर कैसा होगा बैकग्राउंड कलर कैसा होगा ये सब चीजें बहुत ही इंपॉर्टेंट मायने रखती हैं और बहुत सारे बड़े-बड़े टूल्स हैं जो इसके लिए पैसा भी चार्ज करते हैं तो यहां पर हम यह टूल क्रिएट करने वाले हैं और यहां पे और यहां पे कुछ बड़े टूल्स हैं जो कि पैसा भी चार्ज करते हैं तो यहां पर हम यही क्रिएट करेंगे एi बेस्ड ब्रांड मोड बोर्ड जनरेटर जिसमें हम फाइंड करेंगे कंप्लीट ब्रांड किट बनाकर देखेंगे जिसमें कलर फॉन्ट और स्टाइल सब चीजें होंगी तो यह हो गया यह हमारे लार्ज टूल की कैटेगरी में आ जाएगा तो यहां पे लार्ज टूल के कैटेगरी में हम ये दो टूल एंटर कर देंगे ठीक है अब हम क्या करेंगे लाइक इन टूल आईडिया को प्र्प्ट्स में कन्वर्ट करेंगे तो यहां पे हम लिखते हैं प्र्ट अपने बॉक्स में और हम क्या करते हैं चैट जीपीटी पे जाते हैं फिर से और इसको बोलते हैं जस्ट राइट फ्रॉम टू टू मेक दिस अभी तक हमारा जो था टूल आईडिया केवल एक आईडिया था अब इसने इसका डिटेल बना दिया है प्र्प्ट्स में यह प्र्प्ट भी मैं आपको दे दूंगा यह प्र्ट क्या है क्रिएट ए YouTube थंबनेल अह क्रिएट YouTube थंबनेल डाउनलोड टूल दैट अलाउ यूजर टू एंटर YouTube वीडियो यूआरएल एंड इंस्टेंटली इंस्टेंटली फच हाई क्वालिटी थंबनेल इन डिफरेंट रेोल्यूशन मैक्स एचडी एंड एसडी टूल शुड प्रोवाइड प्रीव्यू ऑफ थंबनेल एंड ऑप्शन टू डाउनलोड इन मल्टीपल साइज समझ रहे हैं कितना गजब का यह इसने प्र्ट लिख दिया अब इसी तरह हम इसका भी प्र लिख लेंगे ठीक है यानी जो सेकंड स्टेप है हम अपने टूल आईडिया को प्र्प्ट्स में कन्वर्ट करेंगे तो यहां पे हम इसका भी प्र्प एंटर कर देते हैं ठीक है और यहां पे आते हैं सेम बस हम इतना ही कॉपी करेंगे और देखेंगे यह गजब का प्र्ट लिख देता है हमें कुछ देखेंगे क्वेरी हमें चैट जीपीटी पे बड़ा लिखने की जरूरत नहीं होती है हम आसानी के साथ यह काम कर सकते हैं तो यहां पे हमने लिख दिया है और यहां पे एंटर हिट कर देते हैं [संगीत] अब देखेंगे इसने पूरा ये कंप्लीटली प्र्प्ट बना दिया है ठीक है अब हमारे पास हो गया है दोनों टूल का हमारा प्र्ट भी रेडी हो गया तो प्र्ट को मैं ऐसे कर देता हूं ताकि आपको पता चले तो यहां पे अब समझ गए आप अब हम आते हैं नेक्स्ट स्टेप पे जस्ट वन क्लिक में क्रिएट करने के लिए हमारे पास होना चाहिए होस्टिंगर जो कि मेरे पास है तो मैं यहां पे लॉग इन करता हूं अगर आपके पास नहीं है तब भी मैं बताऊंगा कैसे करेंगे ठीक है यहां पर आते हैं वेबसाइट लिस्ट में आते हैं होस्टिंग में लॉग इन करने के बाद यहां पर जाते हैं यहां पर जाने के बाद हम क्या करेंगे ऐड वेबसाइट पे क्लिक यहां पे देखेंगे लिखा है होस्टिंगर होराइजन अर्ली एक्सेस इस पे हम क्लिक करेंगे जैसे हम इस पे क्लिक करते हैं तो यह देखेंगे इंटरफ़ेस नया ओपन होगा जहां पे लिखा व्हाट डू यू वांट टू क्रिएट जस्ट यहां पे जो हमने प्र्ट लिखा है यहां पे हम कर देंगे उसको पेस्ट और नीचे देखेंगे कुछ सजेस्ट कर रहा है मतलब जैसे इमेज कंप्रेसर जो मैंने पहला दिखाया
