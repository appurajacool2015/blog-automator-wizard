owners slots are filling up fast so please check the links in the description and comment box to sign up now with that said let's move over to the main video so okay so let me jump right into the conversation and please watch this video till the very end if you watch half of it and just act upon it it will not make any sense so please watch the complete analysis and I'll be quick i'll pack a lot of things so let's first study Nifty50 this is the Indian market and what has happened in the Indian market is that you will see this gradual decline right so I have already marked this this is a valuation correction right indian markets went little bit overvalued then the valuation had corrected this is the valuation correction zone till here okay then there was a breakout here this entire phase then there was a breakdown due to Trump tariff here somewhere okay and then the market are again up now the likely situation is that we are going to cross this channel make a new high now a new channel might be created something like this and the nifty will go something like this or another possibility is that we might go like sideways like this right so these are the two possibilities that I see right now in the Indian market i am betting on this red channel as of today so if that happens now that will be a start of a new bull run why because a valuation correction has already happened we have bottomed out here this is the logical sensible analysis news channel are not going to tell you all this okay they are their job is to sensationalize everything i'm just genuinely telling you what I'm doing as an investor this is one now what about the US market so let's study QQQM which is NASDAQ here what you will see is that this is a parabolic fall here the fall is very very sharp now on my US-based investing community we had already purchased NASDAQ at a very good level people right now are anticipating that you know what NASDAQ or all that stuff might might not I don't know this parabolic fall might continue who knows but to cut the long story short I'm betting on a bull run even here i don't anticipate the entire correction on NASDAQ to to go above 30% okay so now you'll say that okay here there was a correction of 34% this was the 2021 to 2022 correction but again if you observe this slope this resembles what is currently happening on nifty50 so this was the valuation correction phase and this phase this parabolic fall here the current one this is more of a parabolic fall and parabolic falls typically happen due to uncertaintity in the market so natural question comes that why am I betting that this will not go beyond 30% very simple because Trump tariff thing is mostly resolved now you say yeah right I mean how is Trump's situation resolved see a lot of clarity has come in right so they have isolated China so USS has categorically said that hey we are not fighting against the world we are only fighting against China okay this is the first key critical information or clarity that has been given in the market second is that even on electronics like Chinese originated electronics I think there has been some uh relaxation that has been given so now no one is taking like this entire tariff thing very seriously initially when it started out there was a lot of seriousness yeah such like you know what okay Trump is going to go mad or whatever but now nothing of that sort even they understand that US is going to back down even it is in US's best interest to sort out this tariff issue very quickly so this was an uncertaintity thing the moment this gets corrected the markets are going to rally here okay so therefore if the India market is also rallying US market is also rallying then what will happen right that's a start of a new bull run now I don't know till when it will last correction of course will happen along the way but generally a good time to buy generally a good time not to be holding crazy amount of cash okay so this is my overarching analysis now let me go stock specific that what are the stocks that I'm bullish about okay so let's start with US first so in the US a lot of talk has happened on something like Google okay for example if you check it from its peak Google had corrected by roughly 32% okay i have purchased okay so I have purchased a lot of stocks in the US in this zone right when this channel breakdown had happened lot of fund managers from India are saying that you know what Google is dead no business left because these days I'm using perplexity and these days I'm using like chat GPT and these days I'm using grow and all that stuff and I'm not searching like Google right now this is superficial understanding of Google's business now if you actually uncover Google business basically approximately 60% of Google's revenues come from search okay so 60% now you'll say search means only Google search no in terms of Google they offer a suite of services for example they offer email they offer Google maps they offer documents right so Google docs and all that that you see so ads are shown on this and that entire thing is called as search right so this is called as search revenue now here is the overall revenues of Google year- wise and you can see that the revenues for Google are increasing so it's not as if that Google is on some slippery path you will say that okay see all this perplexity and agentic AI and whatn not this is this is all started to pick up in 2025 so Google to okay See guys basically like uh if you look at the last big war that Google had fought on advertisement revenue whom did it fight against well it fought against Amazon now how Amazon for example Amazon's ad revenue growth rate has been one of the fastest and it has taken a lot of market share away primarily from Google okay so it's not the first time that Google is fighting this advertisement revenue war right this is one and when did this escalation of Amazon in terms of its ad revenue started well this started back in the year 2021 so between 2021 and 2024 Google has already fought this war and it's not as if that it has gone down in business performance no one is using Google less okay so you are still using Google a lot right and you're getting to buy the company at a significant discount your wish you want to buy not buy that's your goal i cannot say anything i'm just helping you understand the entire picture because you'll read some random dudes commenting on the fact that you know what okay Google I'm using like perplexity these days I'm not using Google search that's superficial okay that's not how business analysis is done so please don't act because of that do your own analysis this is one now out of M7 there are multiple good stocks which I will communicate in my community also when exactly to add it because almost all M7s are good it's not as if that they are bad companies it's just that you have to understand the right time to buy okay uh so that becomes really important and M7 stocks also have a lot of volatility right so for example you'll see this dip on Google you will see this dip this entire dip on Google so there's a lot of dips that happen and therefore aggregating or picking the right time to buy these type of stock makes sense and again I'll push that in case you can afford it definitely do join my US-based stock investing community people have given excellent feedback people have loved the experience so far and if you are a serious investor do consider checking it out i detail out almost on everyday basis whatever I'm doing and at this stage I am building a big portfolio in the US okay so this is one now comes Indian stocks so let me first and foremost talk about Nifty IT now what you will see is that Nifty IT also like Google has corrected by roughly 33% okay now you'll say same story that it makes sense to buy like Nifty it okay so here are a couple of problems right uh number one is that there is what I'm witnessing in the Indian market right now is that mismatch between index nifty IT index and the ETF if you buy that's a topic in itself but honestly this is personally that I have witnessed right on my community also that people are buying ETF right so they will go buy ETF and ETF and index are supposed to be same for example if you buy let's say NIFTY's right so this is what this is an ETF of nifty50 okay Now ideally the index and ETF should suppose or should behave exactly the same if there's a 5% drop on index then ETF should also fall by minus 5% okay but there is a tracking error that is happening and this is becoming more and more so this is becoming a nightmare to buy like ETFs in India and even if you place like you'll say I'll not buy ETF I'll buy index only you'll go via the mutual fund route and it will take you two days for allocation now we don't know what date they will give so this is a genuine problem that I'm facing but again this is not a cripping video i'll just tell you like my analysis of Nifty IT uh see Nifty IT is not bad you can pretty much consider building some position on it i'm not doing it because honestly I'm getting like companies like Meta right which are at great value i bought a lot of Netflix okay great value right at right time i I would assume that I bought it google I gave you an example now these things are way way stronger than something like Nifty IT because Nifty IT or Indian IT companies are likely to grow due to second order effect now what is second order effect the first order effect is that US and Europe need to be pro business okay and they will throw some business towards Indian IT and therefore we will grow now if you don't trust the number here are the numbers you can go and check how much export dependence Indian IT has now due to the rise of artificial intelligence machine learning automation of different tasks automation of software generation I don't know what the future of Indian IT looks like so therefore like investing money here now if I have a choice to invest like one lakh in Indian Nifty IT or one lakh in Google I would definitely put pick Google or even just NASDAQ i think that makes more prominent sense then comes that okay now then what type of stocks will you pick in India so I think finance works really well very happy with my bets a lot of people made fun idiots like absolute idiots sorry to say it right but honestly if you had no no guts to buy like something like HDFC when it was available at massive discount it saved everyone right i mean people who were holding decent positions of banks like HDFC private banks all that they have done exceptionally well so just let me show that to you right and again we will just take a look at maybe HDFC right how much returns it has given so last one year it has given roughly 20.77% return and if you take a look at nifty50 last 1 year how much return it has given it has given 2.5% return so it's approximately like whatever 17 18% right now that's huge alpha that's now that's approximately 1 and a2 years worth of return right so that's honestly the case right and is now now people are imagining that you know what HDFC will not grow and all that stuff see now let's quickly discuss HDFC bank also now here is the situation that if you take a look at the P ratio the PE ratio seems fair Okay business of HDFC Bank is very very solid to cut the long story short even now it is at a good buying level if you're buying something for 2 to 3 years again not a recommendation that you buy okay now I'm just suggesting ideas you pick and choose whatever you feel like okay so according to me private banks are really good you figure out whichever ones you want to buy something like Asian paints right so let me just quickly give you an example that why something like Asian paints or paint based businesses are likely to do well two three triggers number one is that Diwali is going to come in next what 5 6 months now that generally is a very good season number two the reason why Asian paints corrected there were two reasons one is that massive rise of competition in paints industry now you yourself think why would bunch of different people go paints and all that will come into paint industry because why that industry is useful you can make money in that industry therefore people are coming in this industry so it's a lucrative industry to begin with so that competition thing is already sorted those players have already entered and correction Asian paints has already happened okay second key reason for correction was that the rise of input cost that due to inflation input cost or manufacturing cost for Asian paints went up like crazy so what has happened and which is the primary fer for making like paints well it's oil prices now oil prices from its peak have corrected by 50% so what should ideally happen on stocks like Asian Paints ideally it should come back up that's the idea and again you can see that the volume is increasing for something like Asian Paints it is available even below its 200 day moving average line so from that perspective it seems okay now again not a push that you buy this stock only you go and figure out whatever you want to buy i'm just giving you macro commentary okay now this is the next point now if you want to figure out like some stocks that could potentially like 2x 3x and all that then you need to buy companies which are at fairly low PE so for example I'm just picking the example of motil loal financial services here you can see that the stock PE is only 11 okay now is this a good company okay so let us try to figure out cheese right that it gave enough and it is corrected by a lot so for example it used to be at roughly 1,000 rupees now it is at 600 rupees so 40% correction has already happened on this stock volumes are very good is it generating revenues profits yes so if you look at last 5 years compounded profit growth it's 53% and in last 5 years the stock hasn't given like you know it has only grown like 36% caggr so to say so still some room to grow so to cut the long story short you need to identify these type of companies again not a push that you go and buy motil loval all that stuff i'm just giving you some examples so these are the type of stocks that I'm bullish on in the Indian market i will be maxing out my positions on finance stocks very soon in fact banks I have already done complete position building a few months back some individual 2x 3x type of finance companies I will be picking and I will be investing more money in the US market also and one segment that I am bullish on right now on the US segment is their small cap index now the reason why I am bullish on small cap index and let me just quickly show that to you on charts also now in the US there is an index called as Russell 2000 right and let me just quickly present an analysis for it so you will see that from covid it has only gone up by 5% okay so this is one if you go back even right so if you extend this and stretch this to 2018 so almost in 7 years it has given only 5% 6% runup okay now this is like crazy okay so now comes the natural question that okay maybe like small cap businesses are useless in the US so two triggers there number one is that interest rates have been fairly high from 2021 right so 2021 interest rates went high when interest rates are high small cap companies struggle they shut down because they are unable to procure debt that's problem one problem two is that in the US manufacturing was not promoted now some bit of manufacturing will start happening in the US and majority of small cap companies might come from this segment in the US so buying broader index when the interest rates are going down and manufacturing is happening be it like goods manufacturing or software manufacturing in the US it's a healthy sign and it kind of makes sense to invest some money here my last bet will be Bitcoin i'm already aggressively buying it i do believe that Bitcoin is a great neutral currency to which a lot of countries will move eventually and it's a great bet so I am putting money strategically into it again I explain all this on my US-based community in case you guys are interested you can check it out maybe I'll make a separate video on why I believe that BTC or Bitcoin will become the reserve currency of the world or a part reserve currency of the world but I hope you enjoyed this video it gave you clarity on how to design your portfolio if it did do press the thumbs up button and I'll see you soon",
