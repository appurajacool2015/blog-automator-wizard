  "bPtKnDIVEsg": "Hey guys, in today's video I'm going to show you how you can deploy agents from Google's new agent development kit to the cloud. More specifically, I'm going to walk you through the full process of deploying your agents to Google's agent deployment service called Agent Engine. And by the end of this video, you'll have your first agent deployed to the cloud, ready to respond to your real world request. And because you guys are awesome, I'm going to be giving away all the source code in this video, plus some step-by-step instructions completely for free, so you can build and deploy your own agents on your own time. Just check out the link down description below so you can go ahead and download everything today. And don't worry if you're new to Agent Development Kit or the cloud. I'm going to be breaking down everything step by step, so it's as easy as possible to follow. And if you get stuck or have questions for whatever reason, feel free to drop a comment down below. Or you can head over to my free school community where you can talk with me and other like-minded AI developers so we can get you unstuck and moving on your projects. But enough talking, let's go ahead and do a quick overview of the core technologies you're going to be using today so that we're on the same page. And then we're going to head over to the five steps you need to follow to deploy your local agents to the cloud. So let's go ahead and dive in. All right, guys. So before we dive into actually building out and deploying all of our agents to the cloud, we need to understand the core two technologies we're going to be using today. Agent Development Kit and then Vertex AI agent engine. So let's explain what they are and how they work together to deploy agents. All right, first things first is going to be agent development kit. Agent Development Kit is Google's new agentic framework that allows you to build out agents. So if you've used Langchain or Crew AI, Lum Index, any of these agent frameworks, it is exactly like that. So you'll probably recognize a lot of these instructions for creating an agent to where you pass in a model that you want the agent to use. Give it a name and then pass in some instructions on like all right agent. Here's exactly what you need to go off to do. So it should be super familiar to you. A few other cool points to note is agent development kit. You can actually pass in any model. So you could pass in an open AI model, a cloud model, any of them. You're not stuck using the Gemini models from Google. And it is completely free to use just like it is to use link chain or crew AAI. It's actually an open source repository, so you can actually go in, look at the source code, download it, make pull request, whatever you want to do. Now, that's how we're going to create our agents. And then now we need to talk about step number two, which is going to be deploying our agents. And we're going to do that through Vert.Ex AI agent engine. This is Google's platform to make agent deployment as easy as possible. Without a tool like this, creating agents and actually deploying them can be a ton of work, and they've done a really good job of simplifying the whole process and making it super affordable. So, a few things that you need to know inside agent engine, you can actually pass in any type of framework you want. So, I think they have a really good chart down here that explains it all. So, within agent engine, this is where you'll actually be like deploying all of your agents. You can actually pass in any agent framework you want. You could pass in crewi, lang chain, llama index, any agent framework you want. You can pass it in and deploy it through agent engine. And then once a agent is deployed, you can actually go off and make requests to it almost like you would just a regular API. So you can say like, hey agent, take in this request. Agent engine is going to host it, deploy it, and actually run the agent and then spit back the answer to you. Makes it super super easy to do. And a few other things that I think are pretty cool that you would like to know is when it comes to pricing, it's actually super super affordable. It is a pay as you go model to where you only pay as the agent is running, which is super important to me because I don't want to be racking up a huge bill of like hundreds of dollars if the agent only gets triggered once. So basically the way it works is, you know, whenever you send a request off to the agent, it's going to start tracking its time and say, \"Okay, cool. It looks like I ran for a total of 3 minutes.\" And along the way, I used 10,000 tokens. So you're automatically going to pay for the tokens you use. And then on top of that, you're going to pay for the resources that you used. So you can see you're going to pay basically for CPU usage and memory. So if you were to run all in all for an hour, you can expect to pay around 11 cent if you used one core and 1 gigabyte. So all around very affordable, which was I was super impressed with. So very excited that they've made it easy to deploy and basically very affordable as well. All right. So, now that we've talked about what are the two tools we're using, now it's time for us to actually go ahead and see how we're going to create our agents with Agent Development Kit and then easily go ahead and deploy them over to Agent Engine over in Vertex AI. So, if you have any questions on any of that, feel free drop a question down below. I know these are some like more advanced, bigger topics, but let's go ahead now and head into the five core steps you need to go from agent to deployed agent. So, let's go ahead and dive in. Okay, so now that we've talked about the two tools you're going to be using, Agent Development Kit and Agent Engine, let's go ahead and cover at a high level the five steps you need to take to deploy your agents to the cloud. So, first things first, we are going to create an agent using ADK. So, I already have a pre-built one for you that you can just go ahead and download for free down in the description below. Once we have our agent set up on our local computer, then we need to go ahead and start setting up our cloud resources. So, first we're going to go ahead and create a new project in Google Cloud Platform. From there, inside Google Cloud Platform, we're going to enable and set up our AI resources. Once we have the cloud set up to support all the AI functionality, we're on our local computer going to installed Google Cloud CLI. This is going to allow us to log in, access our cloud resources, and it's going to enable us to connect to Vertex AI so that we can actually start to run our agent locally because it'll have access to our Gemini keys and everything else we need to run it. And then finally, once it's up and working and everything's installed, we can then go ahead and deploy our agent to the cloud. And I have scripts and everything else that you need to make this as easy as possible. Like I said, I've tried to break down everything step by step. So let's go ahead and hop over to the first step where we are going to look at the agent that we are going to deploying to the cloud today. So let's go ahead and hit to step number one. So welcome to step number one where we're going to do a quick overview of the agent that we're going to be deploying to the cloud today. So at a high level what we're doing is I've built a shortbot agent for you guys which all it does is this agent takes in a message and then makes it as short as possible to get the same message across. So, as you can see, this looks just like lang chain and crewi where you pass a name, model, and description. You pass in your instructions here where you basically go ahead and say like, hey, this is the task you're trying to perform. And what you can also see is you can pass in tools just like you would normally do with lang chain or crewi. So, inside the tools, you just go ahead and make a normal Python function, give it a parameters, give it the types, give it a dock string of what it should do, and then all the code that needs to run. Like I said, this is more of a deployment tutorial, so we're not getting super fancy with the underlying agent. Okay, so first things first, I have set up instructions for you guys so that you can easily install this and run it locally. So, if you head over to the readme after you download this source code for free, what you can see is I have basically step-by-step instructions to where you guys can, you know, go ahead and install the project. And to install it, you're going to need to use Poetry. Don't worry if you run into any issues. drop a comment down below or you can go ahead and actually talk to Tit and it'll walk you through installing Poetry on your local computer. Once you have installed Poetry, all you need to do is run poetry install and this is going to go off and install all the necessary dependencies that you need to actually run this project. Everything from the Google Agent Development Kit, which is the main one, and all the other tools you need for deploying and everything else. So, that's what's going on at a high level. And then what you can do next is go ahead and activate the environment that you just created. And what this will allow you to do is actually run commands. Specifically, what you can do now is down here, what I've showed you guys is you can actually go ahead and start to run your agent. Now, what you can do is just type in ADK web. And what this will do is it'll go ahead and spin up the web version of this agent so that you can begin to chat with it. Now, I am going a little bit of ahead and step four will actually go ahead and install Google Cloud, which will connect you to Vert.Ex AI, which will actually allow you to like go ahead and start running this. So, this won't work out of the box until we do step four. I just want to go ahead and give you a quick overview of the agent. So, if we head over here, you can see we're now in the web view of our agent. So, up here on the top left, you can see all of our agents that we have running. And then we can go ahead and start to type in messages that will get sent to our shortbot. So, we can say, \"Hey, how was your weekend?\" We can say, \"Anything fun? Have fun with the family.\" And then what it'll do is it'll go ahead and send that message off to our agent. And then our agent will go ahead and type a response back. Sorry, I actually, this is on me. I I meant to refresh the page. So, if we go ahead and send it again, what it'll do is it'll go ahead and actually run. And you can see what I've told the agent to do is give me the original character count, the new character count, and the new message. So you can see basically what it did is like hey this was kind of redundant and what it did is it made it shorter. So you can see the agent's up and running. You can dive in to you know seeing the events that happened, the initial request that was being passed in the response. Don't worry if any of this is confusing. I'm actually going to after this video create a agent development kit quick start where I dive deeper and I'm also going to create an agent development kit masterass. So I'm going to have a lot more content coming out around this but today I just wanted to focus on deployment. So, as you can see, our agent is actually up and running and it works. And you can see that there are instructions that will walk you through exactly how to install your agent and get everything running. Okay, cool. So, we are officially done on the setup. The only other things that I do want to mention that are very important for you to understand how it all works at a high level for agent development kit is the fact that the way agent development kit works is you create agents through folders. So you can see we have an ADK shortbot that is going to be the name of our agent and then within this folder you can see I create an agent.py file. Well that's basically how it works. This is kind of how they want their structure of agent set up. So you can see name of agent here. Then we give the instructions for the agent. This name needs to match this name. It's very important that they match folder and project name. So that was just one thing that tripped me up whenever I first created agents in agent development kit. So yeah. So, that's everything that you need to know at a high level when it comes to creating your agents. And we're going to go ahead and head over to step number two where we're going to start walking you through actually getting everything set up for the cloud. Let's go ahead head over to step number two. So, welcome to step number two where we're going to create your Google Cloud Platform account and the project that you're going to be using to manage all the resources for our deployed agent. So, first things first, inside of Google, just type in GCP cloud and you should see a link to that will point you over to Google Cloud. So, we're going to go ahead and click that. Now, what we need to do next is if you've never created a Google Cloud account before, you're going to want to go ahead and sign up to create an account. It should be completely free to do. If anything, you might need to hook up a payment method. It's not going to charge you anything, but you might be asked to connect a payment method just so that you can access some of the newer features. You won't be charged until you run anything, so don't worry about that, but just wanted to point that out as an important note. Great. Once you've signed up, now it's time for us to go ahead and go over to our console. So, you're going to click console. And what this will do is it'll take you to inside of Google Cloud Platform. Now, if you see a screen like this, yours might be a little bit different if you've never created a project before, but as you can see on my screen, I can see I'm in the Brandon Hancock.io workspace and I'm working on the deploy ADK quickart project. Together, we're going to go ahead and create a new project from scratch so that we're working from the same area. So, what I'm going to go ahead and do is click new project. And I'm going to call this ADK shortbot YouTube. So, this is the name of my project. You don't the naming really doesn't matter. It's just something that you'll easily memorize and recognize when you see it. Now, what you want to do next is click the billing account. So, in my case, I have two billing accounts. You probably will now have one billing account because you went through the setup process. So, click that. And then, when it comes to your organization, I only have one. And then location. I only have one either. So, uh, it should be pretty much just like this except reflect your information. So, next we're going to go ahead and click create. And this will take a few seconds to create your new project, spin up all the resources, and get everything ready. Now, once it's done, you can click this button right here to select your project. And you can see in the top left, it now shows we're working inside the new project. If for whatever reason that didn't happen, you can always just click up here in the top left and research all the projects that you have and click the proper one. So great, we now are done with step two. So let's go ahead and head over to step number three where we're going to enable all of our AI resources. So welcome to step number three where we're going to start enabling all of the AI services inside of your Google Cloud project so that we can start to deploy our agent. So first things first, what do we need to do? We need to enable Vertex AI. So, what we can do is in the top of our search bar, type in Vertex AI and you should see a search result just like this. We're going to click Vertex AI and then we are going to click enable all recommended APIs. And this is going to create Vertex AI Studio and everything else that you need in order to start working with, you know, Vert.ex AI. And a quick reminder, Vertex AI is also going to enable us to start using agent engine, which is the most important thing that we're trying to use here. Now, this does take quite a few seconds to create. So, if you click on this little notification bell in the top rightand corner, you can see all of the different resources and services that it's enabling. Everything from compute, notebooks, data flows, everything that you need. And you can see it also went off and created a bunch of other services right here. So, we're going to let that run. And then what we also need to do is create a new bucket where we can start to store our deploy agents. And what is important to note about this, I'm just going to show you an existing project so you can see it in action. This is something that I created a while ago. And you can see I made a bucket which is where we're going to basically store our deployed agents. And you can see I made previously an ADK shortbot and it got deployed to this bucket. And if you dig in, you can actually start to see some of the like all the different folders and resources stored in order to actually run our agent. So all this is going to get stored to the cloud. Okay. So that's what we're ultimately trying to do. So what we can type in is bucket. And if you go to cloud storage bucket, this is what we're trying to do. And we need to create a new one. So in our case, you're going to click create. And then from here, we're just going to give it a simple name. So I'm going to call it the same name as my project. So ADK shortbot YouTube. And then we can pretty much click continue for everything else. Now, it is important to note that this will cost money, you know, but it's like insanely cheap. So you can see it cost almost 3 cent per gigabyte per month and we're going to be using barely anything. So like we might get charged a penny per month with what we're doing here. So don't worry about it. Like we're not going to be breaking the bank. So click continue. Pretty much click continue through everything and the defaults are usually great enough. And we're going to click and continue. The next one is what we want to do is this one is important. Enforce public access prevention. Basically what this mean is, hey, can the outside world access our stuff? And the answer is no. We do not want the outside world accessing information in this bucket. So that is important that it stays checked. So we're going to click continue. We're going to use the normal soft delete policies and click continue. Basically, go ahead and just click everything as the default and you should be good. So great, our bucket is now set up. Things are great. And if you go back to our notification bell, you can also see that everything has been set up properly. Fantastic. Now, there's one last piece that we need to work on together. So, if you just click back to the root menu, which you can click on Google Cloud, it'll take you back to the root. We need to copy over a few pieces of information over to our bucket. So, we need to copy two things. One, we need to copy the project ID. So, you can click copy. And basically what we're doing is we are trying to update our environment to say, \"Hey AI agent, where do you want me to deploy and use all my project resources?\" That's exactly what we need to set up. So when it comes to Google Cloud Project, we're going to put your new project name here. For cloud location, we're just going to use the default, which in my case was US Central 1. I would recommend using this one as well. Basically, you could use any of the deployed AI enabled locations. There's a huge list, I think about 30 different places that enable access to AI features, but US Central 1 works. So, I would definitely recommend using this. The final thing we need to do is say, hey, where is the bucket that you want me to deploy resources to? So, what you can do is go ahead and type in click cloud storage, which will take you back to your bucket. You're going to click buckets. Then, when you click ADK shortbot or whatever name you gave it, what you can do is you can find the name for it right here. So, whatever name pops up right here, that is the name of your bucket. So, you can come back over here, paste it in. Fantastic. You now have your project set up to where it's pointing to all of your cloud resources. And that's everything that you need to do now that you've enabled all of your AI resources, set up your bucket, and you've updated your environment variables. So, now what we can do is go ahead and head over to step number four where we're going to start setting up Google Cloud CLI to connect your local computer to all of your cloud resources. So, let's go ahead and head over to step number four. So, welcome to step number four where we're going to set up the Google Cloud CLI on your local computer. And this is what's going to allow you to do two things. One, it's going to allow you to actually run your local agents properly because it's going to give you access to Gemini on your local computer to where it's going to pull down all the credentials and give you access to running it. And two, it's going to give you the ability to start deploying your agents to Google Cloud. Now, why are we doing this? Well, if you actually head over to the agent development kit quick start guide, you can see there is a step to where it's like, all right, cool. In order to actually start to use these large language models, which option do you want to do to access the LLM service? And in our case, we are using Vertex AI because that Vertex AI is what also gives us access to agent engine. So, this is exactly why we're following the steps. So, as you can see, it says to set up Google Cloud CLI. So, what you can do is click this link or in the readme docs, I have a link for you to follow to. So, what you want to do, click this link and it'll take you to a website that looks just like this where it's going to say, okay, here are the different platforms you can install Google Cloud CLI on. And in my case, I'm on a Mac. So, all I needed to do was, you obviously are going to click whatever platform you're using, but in my case, I'm on a Mac and I'm using Apple Silicon. So, I went ahead and clicked this and then I downloaded it. Once I downloaded it, all I needed to do was run this command that it tells you to run. And this is going to go ahead and install it on your local computer. So, literally just follow these instructions. And then once it's installed, all you need to do is run Google Cloud Unnit. What this is going to do is allow you to start to run Google Cloud anywhere on your computer. So once you run Google Cloud init, it's going to add it to your path. So you can at any point anywhere just run Google Cloud and it'll start to work on your computer just like this. Great. So I'm going to run Google Cloud init with you because we also need to set up and connect our project to actually point to the proper project. So when you're first using it, it's going to ask you to do two things. It's probably going to ask you to log in. So let me just show you that as well. So you're going to run g-cloud login. And what this will do is actually ask you to sorry G-Cloud off login. So what this is going to ask you to do is go ahead and log in to your account. So I'm going to log in. And then once you log in, you're going to say, \"Yes, I want to accept all of these different permissions.\" Great. You're now logged into Google Cloud CLI. And you can start to run any of the things that you want to do and actually have access to Google Cloud. Then what we can do is run Google Cloud. And this is where we're going to go ahead and start setting up our local environment to start pointing to the proper projects. So yours is going to not show this because you're doing this for the first time. So, you're going to probably just walk through the like, hey, what project would you like to set up? In my case, I'm going to say, hey, I want to reinitialize this to point to the proper project. So, I'm gonna say one, I'd like you to show me all my potential projects. And I'll point to the right one. And before I do that, it's going to ask which account would you like to use to perform? In my case, you saw me just log in with my email. So, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Then, it's going to show me all of my existing projects. Now, in my case, we just created this project. So, number one, so this is the project I'm going to pick. You obviously want to pick the project you created in Google Cloud. Then it's going to say, do you want to configure a default zone? We're not going to worry about that for now. And now you can see, hey, congrats. You are ready to start using Google Cloud and it's connected to this project. So fantastic. You have actually set up Google Cloud to work locally on your computer. And what's really cool is now you also have ability to run that ADK command I showed originally that ADK web where it actually spins up the local agent that we created and runs it. Now that we have access to Vertex AI and all of our Gemini keys and everything else that are just automatically created under the hood, you can now start to actually run this as well. So this is where you can start to come in here, pick an agent. Let's actually go ahead. Sorry, I'm running this from the wrong folder. I was like, why is it showing all those random files? So sorry. You can actually run it here. ADK web. And this is where it'll show all of your different potential agents that you have. And this is where you can start to run it all. So ADK and then hey, how are you? So just to show that's working. So it's going to run. It's going to go trigger it. It's going to original count, new count. Fantastic. So everything is looking good. So we now have our agent up and running. And we are now at the final step where we're going to start walking through how we can start to deploy this agent that we've created now to Google Cloud now that we've set up and connected everything. So let's go ahead and head to step number five. So welcome to step number five where we're now going to dive into deploying your agents over to agent engine. And before we just start running through the code where you're going to see exactly how to deploy these agents, I want to walk you through a few core concepts you need to understand first. So when we're actually looking at the code in just a second, you understand, oh yeah, that is what's happening and I understand why all the different parts are moving the way they are. Okay. So let's look at a few of the most important things first. So what we've done so far is we have created an agent and now that agent can run locally on our computer and what we're trying to do is two things. One, we want this agent to get bundled up into a container and deployed over to Vertex AI engine. That's exactly what we're trying to do here. And under the hood, when we dive in the code, you're going to see that this is actually super straightforward. You really will do two things. You are going to create the engine, and it's going to be called a reasoning engine cuz we're basically almost like building a chat agent is what we've done so far. And so, we're creating a reasoning engine. And all we're doing is passing in our root agent, which is our shortbot. And what we're doing is saying, \"Hey, enable tracing.\" And once you've created your agent and it gets wrapped and turned into an application, all we need to do is then deploy it. And we're going to dive more into the code in just a second, but what we're going to do is create a deployment. And how this works is you say agent engine, please create a new engine. And all you do is pass in this application right here. And it's going to take all of the different agents, sub agents, tools. It's going to package it all together and deploy it over to agent engine. And you need to specify two other things. Any requirements. So basically, it's all getting bundled and packaged together. So if there's any specific packages your agents use, like if you're building a weather application and you needed to use like a Python weather SDK or anything like that, you would start adding all of those additional packages right here. So weather SDKs, if you were using some other fancy libraries, you'd pass them all right here. And then when it comes to extra packages, what you want to do is put the name of your package. So in our case, if you actually go look at the code that I wrote, you can see that everything that we're trying to deploy is in the ADK_Shortbot package. So that's exactly what we've done over here where we just say, \"Hey, the only package you need to deploy is ADK shortbot because this includes all the agents you need for deployment.\" So that's what we're putting there. So that's the only thing you need to put in the extra packages. Okay, check. We've walked through high level what's happening. Now there's a few core pieces of terminology you need to understand before we start deploying these to the cloud. So so far you've seen how we can create a deployment and we run this Python code and it actually deploys it off to agent engine and what that's going to do is create a deployment. A deployment is nothing more than all the instructions needed to run the agent. So it's just sitting there waiting to be used. Then what we can do is create a session. And a session is nothing more than saying okay I would like to use this deployed agent and now I'm going to start having a conversation with it. So a session is nothing more than a conversation with an agent. So hopefully that makes sense. So let me show you some examples of this in action. When we were using our ADK web earlier in the browser, you saw how we could chat with our agent. So you can say we're chatting with this agent. And every time we create a new conversation, it's going to add a new session. And if you remember, a session is nothing more than messages. So if you actually click into a session, what you'll notice is it just shows this. It just shows a summary of all the messages we pass back and forth between us and the agent. If we had more tool calls, it would show the tool calls in here. And that's pretty much everything you need to know when it comes to deploying agents. There's deployments and there's sessions. Deployments contain all the instructions and packages and everything needed to run the agent and sessions are actual conversations with messages with that specific deployed agent. Okay, so hopefully that makes sense and you kind of see how the dots connect. And don't worry, we're going to actually now that you've seen these highle concepts, we're going to hop over to the code, deploy our agent, go ahead and start creating new sessions. And once we've created a session, you're going to see us actually start chatting with the agent back and forth. So let's go ahead and hop over to the code where we're going to start taking action on everything you just learned. All right, guys. So, welcome to the code portion of deploying your agents to agent engine. And before we dive in to look at the code, I just want to mention that I've created a script for you guys to make deployment as easy as possible. And I've tried to set it up in a way to where you can just type in the command line and perform all the actions that you would like to do. Specifically, I have set up the code in a fashion so that you can create and delete and list all of your deployments that you've made to agent engine. And then outside of that, I've also set it up so that you can look and start to chat with all the sessions that you create because you remember sessions are where we chat to. And then finally, I've set it up so that you can easily send messages and start to chat with your deployed agents in one of these sessions. So this will make more sense and we're going to actually walk through it part by part. So don't worry if any of this is confusing. We're going to go step by step and hit each one of these. Okay, so first things first, what we need to do is create our own agent and deploy it to agent engine. This is the exact same code that you guys saw earlier where we're going off and first creating the application and then deploying the agent application to Google Cloud App Engine. So here's what we need to do. If you come down to your terminal, you can type in poetry run and then you can type in deploy remote. Now, let me break down each part of this so it actually makes sense on why we're doing each thing. So, poetry, this is what we're using for our package management. And what we're doing is saying, \"Hey, I would like you to run this script.\" So, where the heck is this script defined? Great question. If you head back over to pipro.tl, you can see that I've created a script for you guys, which is deploy remote. And deploy remote calls the deployment python file. and it calls remote sorry it goes to the deployment folder calls the remote Python file and runs the main function. So that's exactly what we have. So here is our deployment folder with our remote Python file and then inside of that we are trying to run this main function. So that's exactly what we have here folder file function. Okay, cool. Hopefully that makes sense. So now what we're going to do is we would like to go ahead and create our deployment of our agent. So I'm going to run it first just so you can see how it works. We're not actually deploying and creating it yet. I just want to show you that it's going to give you all the possible options that you can run to basically use this deploy script. In our case, we're trying to create our deployment which is going to push our local agent to the cloud. So we're going to run at the very end of this command d-create. And I'll make it a little bit bigger for you guys so you can see too. So now when I run create, what it's going to do is go, thank you for giving me everything that I need. I'm going to install all the proper dependencies that I need. And then from there, once I know everything I need to install, I'm going to use that bucket that you created earlier and we set up in our environment variable files. And I'm going to start saving everything over to our Google storage bucket. So, I'm going to save all the instructions dependencies and I'm going to go ahead and build this agent and save it in a zip file over to our bucket. And then once it's saved everything to the cloud, things are happy. Then it's going to kick off agent engine and saying, \"Hey, you here's all the raw ingredients you need. Now, please go forth and deploy this agent.\" And you can actually look at the progress of this agent in real time to see where it's at in the deployment process. Quick heads up, this can take like up to 10 minutes to deploy an agent. So, you know, get a cup of coffee and wait. But let me show you what's going to happen in real time. So, if we click on that link, we can look at the logs, the deployment logs in real time. So, let me go ahead and make this full screen for you guys. So, what we can see is we are in our correct project. And then you can see in real time it is going through the entire deployment process. So, you can see, let me zoom out. Oops. Sorry. It doesn't like being in this like half state. So you can see in real time what it's doing is it is going okay cool all those packages you put in listed in our Google storage bucket. I'm going to go ahead and download everything in the bucket that you told me to download. And I can actually show this to you in real time. So if we hop back over over here and we go to our cloud storage bucket, you can see that our new everything that we talked about is actually deployed. So you can see in our agent engine folder, you can now see it has all of our requirements. So you can see if I was to actually look at this. So we'll go ahead and look at it just so you can see it. So you can see it has all of the proper dependencies needed to actually run this agent. And then what it's doing is it's downloading everything and those requirements file. And from there what it's doing is it's installing all the dependencies in real time. And what it's trying to do is fully download create the container and get it ready to be fully deployed on agent engine. So, what I'm going to do is do a quick pause and we're going to come back once the agent is fully deployed because like I said, it can take up to 10 minutes. And I'll show you that it's running once it's done deploying. All right, guys. So, it just deployed our agent to agent engine, and we can confirm that it properly deployed it by running the list deployments command. So, you can see we have an extra function in here that's going to say, \"All right, agent engine, please list out all the deployments so I can see what's actually been deployed to the cloud.\" So to run this, all we need to do is go back and see what available commands we have to us. And in our case, we want to run the list command. So come back up here, type in list. And now we should see that we have a deployed agent on agent engine. Fantastic. This is the exact agent we wanted to deploy. Now we can move forth with creating a new session. And a session is nothing more than a conversation between us and our deployed agent. And the important variables that you need to pass in when creating a session are the resource ID. So this is like hey what deployed agent should I talk to. Also which user is talking with the agent. This doesn't need to exist anywhere else. Like this you know usually would just come from your application. And the reason agent engine put this in here is so that at any point you could go up and look to figure out all the different conversations a specific user has had with a specific agent. So that's why they put it here. It's really just to help you list out sessions later on. So, let us go ahead and try it out. So, we're going to copy the resource ID because that's what we needed. And in this time, what we're going to do is run the create session command. This is what we're running this time. So, we're going to type in create session. Create session. And then pass in the resource ID. And if you don't pass in a user ID specifically, it just uses test user by default. So, that's totally fine with me. So, we're going to go ahead and create our session. And this will take a few seconds and showcase the new session results. So, tada. You can now see I just created your session for you. Here's the new session ID. Here's the user ID, in our case, test user, and everything else you need to know about the new session with our agent. Great. So, now that we have that set up, what we can do is fetch that specific session just to show that it was created properly. So, what we can do, you can see we have a get session flag. We'll actually skip it and we're just going to go ahead and chat with the session. But just know you could list out all your sessions for our specific user and you could grab a specific session to see all the message history. But in our case, let's go ahead and have fun and send the specific message. So going back to earlier, we need to call the send flag. So in our case, send is the new command we're trying to run. So we're going to type in send. And now we can look up what information do we need to provide. Well, resource ID, we have that. What else do we need to provide? We need to provide the user ID. In our case, this was just test user. And then finally, we need to pass in the session ID. So session ID, you can grab that right here. And then what we need to do is pass in the actual message itself. So you can see message right here. So d- message. And now we can just say like, hey, how did your weekend go? Anything fun? And then we can send this off to our agent. And what we should see back in just a few seconds is our agent responding back to us. So you can say, \"We sent this message. How'd your weekend go?\" And then we got back this response. So the original character count was 38. I shortened it to 23 just by saying, \"Hey, how was your weekend?\" So all around it did a good job of shortening the entire thing. So all around super impressed. And that is us actually communicating with our deployed agent. This isn't local. This is a deployed agent running in the cloud to where it's running, doing its thing. So all around, I thought this is amazing. Now, let me go ahead and we're going to hop over next just as a bonus session. I want to show you how you can start to look at traces and logs of these deployed agents. Let's go ahead and look at that real quick. Okay, so as a bonus, I wanted to show you guys how you could look at traces for your deployed agents. And a trace is nothing more than a specific set of messages that have been passed back and forth. It's how you can actually see what's going on between your agent and your users. So, all you need to do back inside Google Cloud, what you can do is type in traces, and you'll should see something called trace explore. That's exactly what we want to click. Once you click trace explore, you can start to see all the different messages that have been sent between you and your customers. So, you can see we have an invocation which goes ahead and if you click on it, you can see how it says, \"All right, this trace shows that agent, specifically the ADK shortbot was called.\" Then you can see, well, what did that agent do? Well, it called an LLM. Then you can dive in here to see everything that happened. So, you can see we called Gemini Flash 2.0. You can see that we gave an instruction saying like, \"Hey, your message is shortening assistant. Here's what you should do.\" You can see the response from the LLM. So, you can actually see everything that happens inside of your agents going through traces. So, this is a really cool way to like look back and see like, hey, what has been happening inside of my agent? Is it been performing properly? You can, you know, if you wanted to, you could do some filters here to say like, hey, I only want to look at LLM calls that have happened and see, well, what are the LLM calls that happen? So, you can actually dig in and see everything here. I thought traces was a super cool functionality and definitely wanted to show it to you guys cuz now you're an expert at deploying agents to agent engine and this is a next step that you could look in to see how your agents are performing.

  "12YlKk40YAI": "Hey guys, Lovable 2.0 just dropped with a bunch of new amazing features to make it even easier to build and deploy real world applications, even if you're not a coder. And in today's video, we're going to look at the five biggest updates of Lovable 2.0. And then you're going to see all of these updates in action as we go off and build a beautiful website just like this, completely from scratch, only using prompts inside of Lovable. And we're going to build it in less than 10 minutes. And because you guys are awesome, I'm giving away a custom GPT that I've created for you guys that helps you create the perfect prompts for Lovable to help you build beautiful websites even faster. Just check out the link in the description below so you can download it for free. Also, don't worry if you're not a coder. Lovable 2.0 has made it even easier to build full stack applications to where even your grandma can do it, which is why I'm so excited to talk about everything in this new release. Also, huge shout out to lovable for sponsoring this video. I've been using them for a while to build my own websites just like this one. And I've loved how easy and simple they've made it to build beautiful websites, which is why I was so excited when they reached out to collaborate to talk about this new release. But enough talking, let's go ahead and cover the five big features that you want to see and go ahead and dive into the live build. So, the first and my favorite update inside of Lovable 2.0 is they've really upped the bar on their visual editing platform. At this point, you can click on any element inside the web application you're building and you have total control over it. You can update the text, the text size, the padding, pretty much anything that you can think of, you can directly control through a guey. And this is a huge improvement from where we were a few months ago where if you wanted to make changes, you would either have to hook the project up to code and you manually go change it elsewhere or you would have to spend an extra credit to say, \"Hey, can you please make the text this much bigger?\" So, this is a huge improvement to make it more cost-effective and easier to use to get better results. Super excited about this first update. And the second feature I'm super excited about is Lovable is now fully supporting dev mode, which means you can easily toggle back and forth between prompt and preview and code and preview. So if you're a developer like me and you want to get your hands dirty, you can easily now do it. And my favorite part is all of the changes you make, you can easily press save and it will save it directly to GitHub, which is a huge improvement of where we were a while ago to where you would have to manually edit everything over in GitHub and import it back in. Now it's just super easy to all edit in one place. Super excited for you guys to try this one out. And the third new feature you're going to see inside of Lovable 2.0 is their new chat mode agent. And I can go ahead and tell you this thing is a beast. You can use it to ask questions about your project or you can have it help you debug issues. Or my favorite is you can use it to plan out big changes and updates inside your applications. And it's great because you get to make sure you and the agent are on the same page before it goes off and makes changes. But once you are both on the same page, it has a nice little button for you that says implement changes and then it just takes care of the rest for you from there. Absolutely love this one. Super excited for you guys to try this one, too. And the fourth new feature you're going to see inside of Lovable 2.0 is their new multiplayer mode, which allows you to bring in your friends, co-workers, and other contributors to your projects so that you all can work on the same project. This one is amazing because in the past, everything inside of Levable was single player. So, it was pretty much you working on it. If you wanted to make changes, you had to send it over to GitHub where you could have other people to start to work on the project. But now you can all work in one unified workspace, which is Lovable, and make all the changes you guys want, and you can share all the billing credits under one account. Absolutely love this feature. And the fifth major update you're going to see inside of Lovable is you can now buy your own custom domains all inside the application. I absolutely love this one, especially for beginners, because now you don't have to hop across all these different websites to go off and buy your own beautiful domain. and you're actually going to see me later in the video go off and buy AI with Brandon.ai and you're gonna see how just how easy it is to buy it and actually start hosting your website on your own custom domain. Excited for you guys to see this one in just a bit. And as a quick extra bonus, I wanted to show you guys some pricing changes that they've made to make everything simpler and more transparent and honestly more affordable. So, let me walk you through the old pricing super fast so you can see what it used to be. So, back in the day, what it was is they had multiple tiers. everything from starter to launch to scale to teams and everything was based around daily limits and then on top of that it was monthly limits. So there were just a lot of moving parts uh and ultimately if you were using lovable a ton you would eventually hit scale and once you hit scale it was confusing cuz it's like I just want more credits. Now I'm having to deal with monthly limits. So it was all around kind of confusing. But now to make things more transparent, more clear, and like I said, more affordable, they've simplified it to now a free tier, a pro tier, and a team uh team tier on the free tier. So, if you just sign up for Lovable today, you'll get five daily credits. So, you can log in, actually crank out a beautiful website completely for free, and you can actually see it. The only gotcha is it's going to be public so other people can see your source code, but it's still a great way to get started and try out the product. Then once you're saying, \"I'm addicted and I can't stop using it now.\" You will hop over to the pro tier, which is 25 bucks a month for 100 credits per month. And what's so nice about this is everything's credit based. So one credit equals one message. And if you want more credits, great. There's uh will be a drop down right here. And you can say, I'd like 200 monthly credits, 300, 400, 500. And basically every 100 credits is around $25. And you can do a ton with a 100 credits. You'll see in just a second when we go build out the application how many credits we use to actually build a beautiful website. So you're going to see, you know, we can go really far with 100 credits. And you're going to get some other features, too. So private project, so you can hide your project so other people can't see the source code. You can invite other editors to start doing the multiplayer mode. And you can start to bring in your own custom domain. So you're going to see all this in just a second. So yeah, those were the five plus one bonus new features inside of Levable 2.0. So now let's go ahead and hop over to the live build so you can see all these features in action. All right guys, welcome to lovable.dev. So this is what the updated version of Leovable looks like. And I'm super excited for us to dive into the live build in just a second. But if this is your first time looking at lovable, I just want to give you a quick tour. So right when you log in, you can easily just type in your prompt right here and create a beautiful web application. As you go off and create real world projects, they'll be able to uh access all of the active projects you have right down here. And then if you're looking for inspiration, they have a from the community tab. So you can see in real time all the different projects that people are working on to get inspiration and just see what people are making. So absolutely love it. Now in our case, we are going to be doing a live build to showcase all the new features that you just saw. And as I mentioned at the very beginning of the video, I have built a special GPT for you guys that will create the perfect prompt for you guys to make building a website inside of Lovable so easy and just make the results honestly beautiful. Lovable already does a phenomenal job and this just helps you with getting the ideas out of your head and into a prompt. So all you need to do is click the link down description below to go over and get this GPT prompt generator. And what it'll do is it'll walk you through a few quick questions about like, hey, what are you trying to build? you know, what's the goal and what you're trying to do from there. And after answering a few questions, it's just going to go off and generate a beautiful document that's going to contain all the information needed for Lovable to create an amazing website for you. So, it's cranking out so much code. So, what I've done is I've copied the code. Um, and what we're doing in our case is saying, \"Hey, please build me a portfolio website so that I can say, \"Hey, here's all my YouTube content, and if you want help building out AI agents, come work with me.\" That's all we're trying to do. That's all the GPT has done. So, what we can do is just paste in the result from the GPT and give it over to Lovable. From there, Lovable is going to take in our huge prompt that's going to contain everything from the copy for the website, the style of the website, and everything else needed to go off and create our website. And it's going to spin out and start cranking up an entire Nex.js application completely completely for for free and super fast. Just if you remember from the beginning, you get five free credits. So, this could be one of your credits to go off and create the initial part of your application. So, we're going to give it a second while it's going off and cranking out our website, and we're going to pop right back in once it's done building. Okay, guys. So, it took just a few more seconds to go off and build our website. But look how amazing the final result is. And this is after a single prompt. This is crazy how good it did. So, as you can see, we have a amazing hero section saying like, \"Hey, AI with Brandon, email me. Here's some information about me.\" and just continual call to actions. We'll fix some of these buttons in a second, but overall amazing for the first attempt. From there, I told the prompt that I wanted to showcase my latest YouTube videos. So, it did a great job of making a new section to showcase all my videos. Don't worry, in just a little bit, we'll actually put in real videos, you know, just to help you get ideas on how you can actually interact with lovable and make changes. And then from there, it has an awesome footer section to where it's like, hey, once again, call to action. Do you want to work with me? Cool. you know, help I'll help you build out your AI agents. Just email me and here's some examples of what I can work on. So, all around crazy that it did this in a single, you know, a single try. So, what we're going to do next is start working on showcasing how you can start to use some of the new features to fix and make improvements to the application that you just built inside of Lovable. Okay. So, the first thing I want to show you guys is the new visual editor. So, in order to make changes to a specific component inside of our application, we can click the edit button down here. And what it'll do is it'll go, okay, great. Which application do you want to change? So, in our case, what I want to do is update this span right here. So, specifically, what I want to say is, hey, please drop the email icon here. And basically what we can do is it'll go off and it'll make the change in real time to where it's going to say, \"Okay, I understand where in the source code this icon is at. I'm going to remove it, save the file, and then I'll update the preview.\" So this should take just a second to go ahead and fix the email button. So you can see in real time it's editing it. It should be changing it, and it dropped it. Okay, great. So now we have fixed that part of the code. And now what we can do is once again try it on somewhere else. So, we have the edit button toggled. So, let's go ahead and do this edit. And in this case, the cursor flashing keeps happening in the wrong spot. So, um you can also see inside of here, we can change anything as well. So, we can update the, you know, the style of the text. We can change anything that we wanted to. So, in our case, what I want to do is just say, let's say discard because I clicked the wrong thing. So, discard. Sorry about that. And what we'll do is click this section right here and just say, \"Hey, there are some issues with the cursor inside of this component. It is always on the right, sorry about that, long day side of the screen. So then what we can do now is send it off and it'll go, okay, hm, why is that happening?\" It'll go off and fix it. So all around this is just crazy that we can just type to lovable it give it the issues we're having. It'll analyze the code and then from there it'll go off and make the fixes in order to actually make the changes happen. Uh so we can get rid of bugs which is crazy because once again nothing so far has required you to understand code. All you need to do is just identify a problem and then translate it and tell it to lovable for it to go off and make the necessary changes. So, we're going to give it just a second to go off and quickly update this cursor issue real quick, and then we're going to showcase some of the other features inside of Lovable 2.0. So, we gave Lovable a few more seconds, and it was able to fix the typewriter effect. So, now it's looking flawless to where it's typing in and out my different things that I do instead of having the cursor over here randomly. So, this looks amazing. So, now let's go ahead and look at one of the next features, which was going to be the chat feature. Now, this one is crazy how good it is. So, let me show it to you. So, what you can do is click chat. And as you can see, when you click chat, it's gonna allow you to work with lovables agent that is going to understand what you want before making changes. So, let me show you this in action. So, what we're going to say now is go, okay, I would please like to make some changes to this YouTube section. I don't want to have all of these different category tags that you can see right here. And then when it comes to my actual videos, I don't want to show these placeholders. I want to show my actual videos. So here are links to all of my videos and the title for each one of those videos. So now what we can do, like I said, click chat and then press enter. What this is going to do in our case is come up with a big plan of going, okay, I understand the website's current state. I understand what you want and now I am working and brainstorming a new plan of how I can make this come to action and what I'm going to do to you is present this plan in real time so you can see all the changes I want to make. So I want to update the gallery. So I want to get rid of all the current stuff. Then what I want to do is actually enhance the video data. So everything's fake right now. It's mock data. And I want to show the real YouTube ID. So when someone clicks it, it takes them over to YouTube. And then I want to make the each one of these card elements more beautiful. So right now um you know we just have very light animations and I want to make it look a lot prettier. So this is what it's recommending. And then like I mentioned earlier, this thing is a beast. So once you're on the same page as it, you can just click the implement the plan and it'll go off and make all the code changes. And that's exactly what we're going to do. So this takes just a few more seconds to go off and actually look through all the different code and look at the plan and make all the changes. So, we're going to give this a few more seconds so you can see implement this plan in action. So, after just a few seconds, Lovable was able to crank out the plan that we gave it. And the updates are crazy. So, now you can see it's pointing out to all of my videos that I've been working on on my YouTube channel that I gave it. So, you can see it has beautiful like nice little effects for each one. So, now we can have like a nice little play button and when I actually hover over it, it, you know, shows a nice animation. So, all around it did a great job showcasing my portfolio. And now what I want to do is dive into one of the other features that Lovable just dropped, which was their inline code editor. So you don't need this if you're not a developer, but if you are a developer, I just want to showcase how powerful it is. So what we're going to do inside the code is drop this section right here. So this was just like a madeup quote and we're just going to get rid of it. So what we can do is in the top right hand corner, there's a new button that allows you to switch over to dev mode. So once you're in dev mode, you can see all your source code. And to get a better sense in of the code, you can actually collapse this editor over here on the lefth hand side. So now you're just in full code mode. And this is where you can see everything inside of your Nex.js application. In my case, you know, if you're familiar with Nex.js code, you can see all the different things in here. And I believe this will probably be the work with me section. Yeah, this is definitely the work with me section. And we're going to scroll down to the bottom cuz this is where it made up that one quote that I don't want anymore. And I can easily come in here and delete it. So I'm just going to press delete. And what's amazing is now what you can do is just click save changes. In the past this used to be a big sticking point because what you had to do was go all right lovable. Sorry you're actually connected up to GitHub. Don't worry if you don't know about GitHub. Um, but basically you're saving all your changes to uh GitHub and now what you have to do is go make changes in a different editor and then save those changes, push them back up, reloadable. It used to be a whole ordeal, but now you're just directly making the changes right here inside of Level. And it's so easy to do. It's crazy. So now you can just click save changes. Everything should uh take just a second to save everything to GitHub. And now whenever you look back at the preview, you can see that it completely dropped that random quote at the end. So, that was so easy to make some amazing changes. And now what we can do is open back up our editor over here and everything's great. You can see that we just saved some changes in our code editor. Now, if you did want to add it back, something else that Lovable does that just makes it super easy. If you ever make a mistake, you can easily just click restore and you'll go back and undo a change. So, I can just show it to you real fast. So, if we want to get rid of that code change, we can just click restore. It'll take us a few seconds to actually load everything back up. It's working on undoing those changes. Success. We restored. And now it's back. But hey, I don't want it. I just wanted to show you guys that it does work. So, it takes just a second. So, all right guys. So, now what we're going to do is head over and start looking at how we can start to publish our application and buy your custom domain now that we have a perfect beautiful website uh spun up. And publishing is super easy. All you need to do is in the top right hand corner, click publish. Now, what this will do is it will automatically by default publish to a lovable domain for you. So, lovable.app is where it'll all get published and whatever the name of your application is. So, up here in the top left, that's usually what the domain you're going to be given. So, you're just going to click publish. And what this will do is it'll take a few seconds, but it's like packaging all the code together, deploying it for you, handling all that complexity, so you never have to worry about it. So, now you can see your app is fully deployed. So you can click the little link and it'll take you to your website to where you can see it in all of its glory. And this thing looks amazing, guys. And we did this in like a few minutes. It's crazy that we could build all of this in a few minutes. So all round absolutely crushed it. Love what Lovable has done, hence the name. So now what I want to do is walk you through the process of buying your own domain inside of Lovable just so you can see how easy it is and how you can update the domain you deployed to. So, you're not deploying to lovable, you're deploying to your own URL. So, we're going to go ahead and walk through it real quick. First thing you need to do is click manage. When you click manage, it'll take you to the settings page and it'll give you two options. If you already have your own domain that you've bought somewhere else, click add domain. But if you want to buy it through Lovable, I would uh just click this link right here, and it'll take you over to this page right here. So, it's going to take a second to spin up. I think they're just getting a ton of traffic right now. So, it's a little slower to start, but we're going to give it a few seconds and then we're going to come back and start trying to buy our own domain. All right, so what you need to do, go ahead and delete whatever it has in here and type in whatever domain you want to. And it has some extra cool features that you'll see in just a second where it includes AI to help you come up with ideas. But go ahead and type in your first domain by default. So, in my case, I'm going to do AI with Brandon. Make sure I spelled it right. Yep. Andai. And we're going to go ahead and click check availability. Now what this is going to do is say all right is this domain available in my case it is. So what I can do is buy the domain. Now for whatever reason if this domain was not available you can actually search for other domains. So down here let me zoom in for you guys so you can see it a little bit better. So you can see down here what we can do is search for other ones. So if this one doesn't work and I was going to be like Brandon does AI, I can search with generated uh domain name. So, I'm going to say Brandon Brandon AI developer developer. And then we can click generate domains and it'll go off and search for us to be like, okay, based on what you want to do, here's other domains that you could buy. And some of them are stupid cheap. And then other ones aren't. I definitely want to go for a.com, aapp, or aai. So, I'm not going to look at those. And I'm going to go back to add to cart. And I'm quickly just going to buy everything. So, you know, it's a two-year subscription. Just to give you guys an update on like pricing, I've bought domains, other AI domains, and they usually run me around $69 per year. So, this is honestly a really good deal. So, I'm going to go through the process of buying it real quick and then once it's done, we're going to hop back over and I'm going to show you how you can change to deploy your apps uh your own app to your own new website. So, give me just a second. Oh, and something else I just want to show you that pops up immediately next is Lovable gives you the option to easily hook up Google Workspace. So, if you want to have your own custom email, so in my case it would be Brandon at AI with Brandon, I could easily click add to cart and this would give me that email capabilities. But I'm going to skip it for now and just buy strictly the domain. So, one second and then we'll be right back. So, I just bought a domain and this is what the screen looks like after you're done where it says like, hey, you brought the domain and it's going to be automatically configured to work with lovable. It could take some time for everything to get configured, but we should be good to go. So, we're going to click finish. And then we're going to, in our case, go back to publish. And now what we can do is see that we have two different domains now. So, we have our current one that came automatically. And now we have a new one. Now, you can see it's spinning cuz it's taking some time to officially connect everything. So, you can see it's just pending. So, what we're going to do is take a quick pause while it's in that 10-minute grace period. And as soon as it's ready, we'll go ahead and record it. And I'll show you guys how you can fully deploy and we'll go check everything out. So, it took about 10 minutes just like it said it would. And now everything is officially connected. No more white dot. And what you can do is if you go off and publish right now, what'll happen is it will now publish to both of our domains, which is super nice. It's one click and we get everything deployed to both of our different domains. Now, this isn't going to work. However, I'll show you why. So, u if you click right now, it's going to go and take you to this failed site. So, what we need to do is if you bought a domain just like me, what you'll do is you'll go over um you'll get some emails saying like, \"Hey, here's your link to login.\" And in our case, we need to activate this SSL thing, which is basically allowing, you know, secure HTTPS, which stands for hypertext transfer protocol secured. And that's what we're trying to do. So, we're just went to do the activate now, the SSL starter kit one. It takes a second then everything is officially Yeah. Everything is officially secure. So you just click wait a second and I agree. I agree. I agree. Set up SSL. I'm going to download the private key. So yeah, tada. You now have officially made your website secure. So you're not going to get that issue anymore. So I just want to show you guys that cuz that definitely was tripping me up at first until I realized what was going on. So now it probably will take a little bit to propagate everything. None of this stuff is instant. We'll update one more time just to make sure. But yeah, usually anything related to buying a domain, setting up all these uh certificates takes extra time. So don't get freaked out if it takes, you know, a little bit up to sometimes an hour or so to uh to officially be connected. But now, yeah, we're going to give it a little bit more time and I'll let you guys know once it's ready to go. So I gave it a little bit more time and now everything is golden. So now whenever I click to go off to my website, now it officially directs everything over to where you can see AI with Brandon. We have our beautiful website built with lovable. We have some amazing looking animations. You can click to email me where it'll be directed to actually, you know, sending me an email to work with me. You can see all the videos I've been working on and you can, you know, once again say, hey, call to action. You want to build an AI agent, work with me. And once again, this was all created with Levelable, which is crazy. I'll actually have a link to this uh website down in the description below so you can see it yourself and test it out just because I think this thing is amazing. So, I hope you guys are as excited about Lovable 2.0 as I am. And I definitely recommend checking out the link in description below so you can head over and check out Lovable yourself to start creating your own beautiful websites. And also, if you would like to see me to do a deeper dive into Lovable and connecting up to Superbase to start building out deeper full stack applications, definitely drop a comment down below so that I know that you guys want it and I can build it for you guys. But yeah, definitely recommend checking out all the other videos I have on my channel and cannot thank you guys enough for watching this one today. See you. Talk to you in the next one. Bye.",
  "Tc69MFchD0U": "टॉपर इज इक्वल्स टू जिंदगी बर्बाद हो गई है। यह मैं नहीं कह रहा हूं। हंसराज कॉलेज की एक टॉपर स्टूडेंट बिस्मा फरीद ने अपने Lindin पोस्ट में शेयर किया था। 50 से ज्यादा सर्टिफिकेट्स, 10 से ज्यादा मेडल्स, 10 से ज्यादा ट्रॉफीज़ होने के बावजूद मुझे आज कोई इंटर्नशिप तक ऑफर नहीं कर रहा। हमेशा से मेरे प्रोफेसर्स, टीचर्स, रिलेटिव्स सभी ने बचपन से कहा है कि पढ़ाई पर ध्यान दो। वो काम आएगी। लेकिन आज इंटरव्यू में मुझे यह नहीं पूछा जा रहा है कि तुमने स्कोर कितना किया बल्कि यह पूछा जा रहा है कि कौन सी स्किल्स है तुम्हारे पास और मैं इसके लिए कभी भी रेडी नहीं थी। कंपनीज़ नाउ फोकस ऑन स्किल्स रादर देन मार्क्स। तो क्या करें किताबों को आग लगा दे। नहीं नहीं नहीं ऐसा कुछ नहीं है। स्किल तो ठीक है लेकिन कौन सी स्किल्स, कैसे स्किल्स और मैंने न जाने कितनी ही वीडियोस बना दिए हैं जिसमें मैंने बताया है कि स्किल्स सिर्फ तीन तरीके की होती है। हार्ड, सॉफ्ट और हाइब्रिड। और करंट ट्रेंड और करंट जनरेशन के हिसाब से हाइब्रिड स्किल्स पे आपको फोकस करना चाहिए। तो मैं उसके डिटेल में नहीं जाऊंगा। वह आपको लिंक डिस्क्रिप्शन या आई बटन पे मिल जाएगा। बट आपकी अगर कोई और फील्ड है स्पेशली क्रिएटिव फील्ड्स जैसे कि ग्राफिक डिजाइनिंग, वीडियो एडिटिंग, स्क्रिप्टिंग, स्टोरी टेलिंग, मैनेजमेंट, फाइनेंस, कोडिंग तो इन्हें सीखने के लिए इन स्किल्स की जरूरत है। ना ना बाबू खाएगा ना धोखा। यह स्किल्स नहीं है। यह टूल्स है जिन्हें हम स्किल्स समझते हैं। स्किल्स तो यह है जिसको मास्टर किया जा सकता है क्विकेस्ट टाइम में वो भी ₹50 के अंदर। हमें एक बीमारी है डॉक्टर के पास जाते हैं तो वो कहता है कि रूट कॉज पे हमला करना जरूरी है। वरना यह वापस आ जाएगी। कोई भी स्किल हम सीखना चाहते हैं तो उसकी रूट को सीखना जरूरी है। अब इस पेड़ से समझो। पत्तियां सॉफ्ट स्किल्स हैं, तन्हा हार्ड स्किल्स है और डालियां हाइब्रिड स्किल्स है। और मजे की बात यह है कि सबकी रूट कॉज दो ही है और वो है ह्यूमन साइकोलॉजी और प्रॉब्लम सॉल्यूशन। और यह काफी लॉजिकल भी लगता है। अगर हम यह समझ जाते हैं कि सामने वाला इंसान क्या चाहता है। वही उसे वो देना है और कैसे देना है। यही तो सबको चाहिए। एग्जांपल के लिए तुम ग्राफिक डिजाइनिंग सीखना चाहते हो। तुम्हें भले ही पता है कि ये किससे बनाया जाता है लेकिन ये नहीं पता क्या बनाना है कैसे बनाना है तो घंटा तुम उन चीजों का इस्तेमाल कर पाओगे अब मान लो ये एक ग्राफिक डिजाइन है जो Photoshop से बना हुआ है और ये वही सेम ग्राफिक डिज़ाइन है जो उसी सॉफ्टवेयर से बनाया गया है तो तुम कौन सा चूज़ करोगे जाहिर सी बात है यही वाला चूज़ करोगे लेकिन इसमें फर्क क्या है यहां पर कलर साइकोलॉजी का इस्तेमाल अच्छे से किया गया है कंपोज़िशंस का इस्तेमाल अच्छे से किया गया है लेआउट्स का इस्तेमाल अच्छे से किया गया है और उसकी वजह से ये काफी विजुअली अपीलिंग लग रहा है डिज़ तो सेम यही है लेकिन यहां पर कलर स्कीम मिसिंग है। लेआउट का कुछ आता पता नहीं है। इसलिए यह खराब लग रहा है। तो यहां पर हमें साफ-साफ पता चल जाता है कि यहां पर फर्क सिर्फ प्रिंसिपल्स का है। यहां सही इस्तेमाल हुआ है या नहीं हुआ है। तो इस बेसिस पे ग्राफिक डिजाइन अगर आप सीखना चाहते हो तो उसके बेसिस पे ये रूट स्किल्स आती हैं। जैसे कि कलर साइकोलॉजी, कंपोजिशन, स्टोरी टेलिंग। अगर आप वीडियो एडिटिंग सीखना चाहते हो तो पेसिंग एंड अराउजल स्टोरी थ्योरी, आई पैटर्न साइकोलॉजी, सिनेमेटोग्राफी, कलर साइंस, स्टोरी टेलिंग अगर सीखना चाहते हो तो ह्यूमन साइकोलॉजी, रिलेटिबिलिटी, कम्युनिकेशन और नरेटिव बिल्डिंग सेम यही चीज आप कॉपीराइटिंग में करते हो और कोडिंग और मैनेजमेंट में ये रूट स्किल्स आ जाती हैं। तो, यह कुछ क्रिएटिव फील्ड्स हैं जहां पर रूट स्किल्स यह होती हैं। अब आप कहोगे कि साले एक थप्पड़ मारूंगा खींच के। स्पोर्ट्स और कुकिंग में क्या ह्यूमन साइकोलॉजी का यूज करेंगे? तभी तो मैंने बोला। तो ये कुछ क्रिएटिव फील्ड्स हैं जहां पर रूट स्किल्स ये होती हैं। अब कुकिंग के अंदर यह रूट स्किल्स आ जाती है और स्पोर्ट्स में ग्रॉस मोटर स्किल्स और देखा जाए तो ह्यूमन साइकोलॉजी का यहां मतलब आ जाता है गेम सेंस। अगर आप उस मोमेंट में अपनी गेम सेंस नहीं लगाओगे तो कभी कुछ ना करके भी देखो। ईट फाइव स्टार डू नथिंग। तो आप खुद तय कर सकते हो कि आपकी फील्ड के हिसाब से कौन सी रूट स्किल्स सीखनी जरूरी है और वो ढूंढना जरूरी है और उसे कैसे सीख सकते हैं उतना जानना है बस अगर आप यह सोच रहे हो ये कितनी एडवाइस दे रहा है तो इसका प्रैक्टिकल सबूत मैं आगे वीडियो में दूंगा अभी बताना हिम्मत है तो खैर आगे की छोड़ो अभी दे देते हैं यह मेरी फर्स्ट वीडियो है चैनल की जो कि एक पावर पॉइंट वीडियो है। मुझे एडिटिंग का ई भी नहीं पता था। ना ही मेरे पास कोई हाई एंड पीसी था जिसमें मैं हैवी सॉफ्टवेयर को डाउनलोड करूं। जैसे ही डाउनलोड करता था वो डाउनलोडिंग के वक्त ही क्रश हो जाता था। तो तुम सोच लो क्या होगा? तो मेरी मजबूरी थी कि मैं छोटे या लेस हैवी सॉफ्टवेयर्स का यूज करूं। जैसे कि फिल्मोरा और इसका इस्तेमाल करते हुए मुझे 5 साल होने वाले हैं। और फिर भी मैं किसी भी हाई एंड सॉफ्टवेयर का जो आउटपुट निकलता है वो आउटपुट मैं फिल्मोरा से कभी-कभी निकलवा लेता हूं। क्योंकि अब मुझे प्रिंसिपल्स पता है जो हर सॉफ्टवेयर में सेम रहते हैं। यानी मैंने बेसिक व्यूअर साइकोलॉजी समझी, कंपोजिशंस का कैसे इस्तेमाल मैं करूं, कलर्स का कैसे इस्तेमाल कर सकता हूं? मोशंस से लूस। खैर, उसके लिए मैंने फुल एडिटिंग प्लेलिस्ट अपने डिस्क्रिप्शन और आई बटन पे दे दी है। अब ऐसे ही आप लोग या बहुत से लोग होंगे जो मेरी तरह सॉफ्टवेयर्स को अफोर्ड नहीं कर सकते। तो वह सोचते हैं कि मैं कोई हाई एंड पीसी जब ले लूंगा उसमें सॉफ्टवेयर डाउनलोड करूंगा और गिनती के कितने? 4 दिन 4 महीने उसके बाद देखो और आप जो वीडियो देख रहे हो अभी वो तक आपके ड्रीम सॉफ्टवेयर पे नहीं बनी है। लेकिन अगर आज भी आप मुझे ऑप्शन दोगे तो मैं डविस चुनूंगा। हां थंबनेल्स के लिए फोटोशॉप। हां इस वीडियो का थंबनेल और बाकी वीडियोस के भी थंबनेल आपके मनपसंद सॉफ्टवेयर Cवा पे बने। हां, भले ही अभी भी कुछ खास नहीं है, लेकिन मैं यह समझता हूं कि मेरी डिज़ नॉलेज अभी इतनी बड़ी नहीं है। बढ़ेगी तो शायद मैं cवा का भी और सही इस्तेमाल कर सकता हूं। लेकिन फिर भी यार बुरे नहीं है। तो इन सब बातों से एक चीज तो क्लियर हो जाती है कि सॉफ्टवेयर्स मैटर नहीं करते। वो सिर्फ एक टूल्स हैं। हां, किसी टूल में आपको ज्यादा छेड़छाड़ का ऑप्शन मिलेगा। किसी टूल में कम मिलेगा। लेकिन आपको अगर बेसिक प्रिंसिपल्स पता है तो वो हर सॉफ्टवेयर में सेम रहते हैं। और अल्टीमेटली तुम क्या बता रहे हो लोगों को? क्या बताना चाह रहे हो और लोग समझ पा रहे हैं कि नहीं उस पे डिपेंड करता है कि तुम्हारी स्किल कितनी है। हां, मैं मानता हूं कि सॉफ्टवेयर्स में प्रोफिशिएंट होना एक अच्छी स्किल है और सबको आनी ही चाहिए कहीं ना कहीं। लेकिन अगर ना भी कर पाओ तो बेसिक स्किल से आप दूसरे सॉफ्टवेयर्स में भी जंप कर सकते हो। एक तो तुम्हें एग्जांपल बहुत दिखाने पड़ते हैं। ये देखो। यह थंबनेल किसी डिजाइनर ने मुझे मेल किया था। और जब मैंने उनसे पूछा कि ये किससे बनाया है आपने? तो उन्होंने जवाब दिया Photoshop। और यह मेरी पिछली वीडियो का थंबनेल जो cवा पे बना है। अब देख लो यार। फर्क इतना ही है कि यहां पर कंपोजिशंस और कलर थ्योरी का इस्तेमाल सही किया गया है। तो ऑटोमेटिकली ही अगर यह प्रीमियम सॉफ्टवेयर पे नहीं भी बना है तब भी अच्छा थोड़ा लग रहा है। अब तुम कहोगे ये साइकोलॉजी भाइकोलॉजी कहां से सीखें भाई? और इसमें पैसा नहीं लगेगा क्या? और कोई सिखाता तक नहीं है यार। अगर तुम रियल डिजाइनिंग सॉफ्टवेयर्स नहीं रियल डिजाइनिंग सीखना चाहते हो तो सरी ग्राफिक्स YouTube चैनल पर जाओ और पूरी साइकोलॉजी और व्यूअर पर्सपेक्टिव को कैसे शेप किया जाता है शेप्स कलर और कंपोजिशंस के जरिए वो तुम्हें पता चलेगा। उसके बाद तुम जाओ पिक्सम परफेक्ट पे सॉफ्टवेयर को सीखने और इन दोनों चैनल्स का कॉम्बिनेशन ही परफेक्ट है आपको एक अच्छा ग्राफिक डिज़र बनाने के लिए। लेकिन एक Instagram पेज जरूर है वो एक फॉलो कर लेना। आपकी क्रिएटिविटी के तार खुल जाएंगे बिल्कुल। उन चैनल्स के नाम है pिकट. AI या pिकट अंडरs डिज़। वहां पर आपको पता चलेगा कि यार एलिमेंट्स का इस्तेमाल कैसे किया जाता है डिज़ाइंस के अंदर। उनके लेआउट और कंपोज़शंस को कैसे बनाया जाता है। विजुअली अपीलिंग कैसे बनाया जाता है? कुछ सेकंड्स के अंदर। एक भद्दे से भद्दे डिजाइन को भी सिर्फ आगे पीछे शिफ्ट करके उसको अपीलिंग बनाया जा सकता है। अगर आपको एडिटिंग सीखनी है और उसकी साइकोलॉजी जाननी है तो यह कुछ चैनल्स हैं YouTube के, inा के और कुछ अदर रिसोर्सेज भी हैं। और घबराना मत सबकी लिंक मैं डिस्क्रिप्शन पे दे दूंगा। आप जाके चेक आउट कर लेना। और यहां तक आपका एक पैसा तक खर्च नहीं हुआ है अभी। और फालतू के कोर्सर्सेस खरीदना बंद करो। और तुम्हें अगर ज्यादा ही कोर्सेज में अपने पैसे लगाने पड़ रहे हैं तो यार बुक्स को खरीदो। वो बेटर अल्टरनेटिव निकल के आता है लॉन्ग टर्म में। एग्जांपल के लिए यह कुछ बुक्स रिकमेंडेशंस हैं जो आपके रूट्स को मजबूत करेंगे किसी भी फील्ड में जाने के लिए। अब अगर तुम्हें ए बी सी डी ही नहीं आती तो अपना नाम कैसे लिख पाते? भले ही तुम ए बी सी डी सीख लो लेकिन इसको स्पीड में कैसे किया जाए? दुनिया 5G की रफ्तार से भाग रही है। जापान 6G हो रहा है वो बात अलग है। हमें सबसे आगे निकलने की दौड़ है। इवन स्पर्म्स की रेस ब्रॉडकास्ट करने के बारे में लोग बात कर रहे हैं। तो तुम तो तुम ज्यादा पीछे नहीं रहना चाहोगे ना। वैसे तो मैं तुम्हें कहता कि पेशेंस रखो, हार्ड वर्क करो। पर रियलिटी यह है कि घंटा कब तक पेशेंस रखूंगा मैं। बंदे भारत में घुसने का टाइम तक लिमिटेड है। तो कब तक पेशेंस रखोगे तुम? ऊपर से तुम्हारा अटेंशन स्पैन भी कम होता जा रहा है। और उसके दो ही लॉजिकल तरीके हैं। पहला तो या आप स्किल मैट्रिक्स को सीखो या दूसरा कोई भी करो। क्या बोला तू? करो। कॉपी करो। तारीफ में नहीं जाऊं। अबे कॉपी मतलब सीखने के लिए ये नहीं बोल रहा हूं कि किसी का कॉपी करके तुम पब्लिक कर दो वो चीज उसे एक इंस्पिरेशन की तरह लो। अब फॉर एग्जांपल मुझे कोई आईडिया नहीं आ रहा है कि मैं क्या बनाऊं एज एन ग्राफिक डिजाइनर तो मैं दूसरों के देखूंगा कि भाई वो क्या कर रहे हैं या प्रैक्टिस पर्पस के लिए किसी और के डिज़ को क्या मैं रेप्लिकेट कर सकता हूं या उसको बेहतर कैसे बना सकता हूं। वो सबसे बेस्ट तरीका होता है किसी भी स्किल को जल्दी सीखने का। वो अच्छा कम्युनिकेट कर रहा है। क्या मैं उसके जैसा कम्युनिकेट कर सकता हूं या उससे बेहतर कर सकता हूं? और जजी में तो एक चीज पॉपुलर हो ही जा रही है। जो कर रहे हो उसकी वीडियो बना दो। आज मेरी कंपनी को स्टार्ट करने का पहला दिन 30 डे सीरीज 100 डे 1 मिलियन सब्सक्राइबर चैलेंज का फर्स्ट डे। तो रील्स या शॉट्स पे अपनी सीरीज चालू करो। जिससे लोग तुमसे जुड़ पाए और तुम्हारी जर्नी को एक्सपीरियंस कर सकें और रिलेट कर सकें। और सीरीज कुछ ऐसी रहेगी कि मैं एक बिगिनर हूं। मुझे एक्सपर्ट बनना है 60 डे में। हर दिन मैं अपना एक ग्राफिक डिजाइन बनाऊंगा और क्या चैलेंजेस मुझे आए वह बताऊंगा। इस सीरीज में मैं अपने और दूसरों के ग्राफिक्स को भी रेप्लिकेट करने की कोशिश करूंगा या उनसे बेहतर बना पाऊं वो कोशिश करूंगा और मजे की बात यह है कि भले तुम फेल भी हो रहे हो फिर भी लोग तुमसे रिलेट कर पाएंगे और लोग तुम्हें फीडबैक भी देके कुछ टिप्पणियां भी करेंगे और इवन एंटरटेन भी होंगे कहीं ना कहीं यानी यह तो एक रियल टाइम स्किल गेमिफिकेशन हो गया। इसमें तो मोटिवेशन की भी चिंता नहीं है। और अगर तुम सस्पेंस और स्टोरी टेलिंग का सही इस्तेमाल करते हो तो ये तो सही है बे। आईडिया तो सही है यार। लिख लेता हूं। लेकिन मिडिल क्लास की दिक्कतें यहीं खत्म नहीं होती हैं। अगर आप क्रिएटिव फील्ड के नहीं हो तो आपके लिए वीडियो यहीं समाप्त है। मैं मिलता हूं आपको अगली वीडियो में। तब तक के लिए बी बिजी। लेकिन अगर क्रिएटिव फील्ड के हो अब मैं यह मान के चल रहा हूं कि आप जो पहला सॉफ्टवेयर यूज करोगे वो AO का कोई सॉफ्टवेयर होगा या Photoshop, PME Pro कोई भी सॉफ्टवेयर होगा। तो जैसा आप जानते हो कि AO को सीखने का कॉस्ट पहले 7 दिन तो वो फ्री ट्रायल ऑफर करता है। उसके बाद उसके तीन प्लान्स शुरू हो जाते हैं भाई। लेकिन अगर मैं आपसे कहूं कि आप एक्स्ट्रा सात दिन भी यूज कर सकते हो फ्री में AO और अगर वो नहीं कर पाओगे तो आपको मैसिव डिस्काउंट्स देखने को मिलेंगे वो भी लीगली बताता हूं कैसे। अब AO के ये तीन प्लांस हैं मंथली इयरली इयरली और मंथली। अब तुम इन दोनों पे कंफ्यूज मत होना। यह प्लान जो है वो फंसाने के लिए है और यह असली मंथली प्लान है। तो लोग जो कहते हैं AOB का मंथली प्लान 700 के आसपास है तो वो है नहीं ऐसा। जो उसका रियल प्लान है मंथली वो 2700 के आसपास का है। उसका एक रीजन है जब आप मंथली इयरली प्लान लेते हो तो आप कमिटमेंट कर रहे हो कि मैं 12 महीने इसका इस्तेमाल करूंगा और अगर आपका मन विचलित हुआ बीच में कहीं कि 2 महीने बाद मैं छोड़ रहा हूं तो आपको पूरे साल के पैसे देने पड़ेंगे। याद रखना कैंसिलेशन फीस लगेगी उसकी तगड़ी वाली। यह मेरे साथ हो चुका है। ऑलरेडी मैंने इसकी वीडियो बना चुकी है कि ₹9,000 मांग रहे थे यार वो कैंसिलेशन के। तो अगर आप एक हॉबीस्ट हो तो मैं आपको रिकमेंड नहीं करूंगा कि आप मंथली ईयरली प्लान लो। लेकिन अगर आप प्रोफेशनल हो तो तो यह प्लान आपके लिए बेस्ट है। लेकिन फिर भी हम फ्री ट्रायल तो तीनों में ही ले सकते हैं ना। तो लेंगे। अब जैसे ही आपका ट्रायल एंड होने वाला हो एक या दो दिन पहले आप अपने क्रिएटिव क्लाउड पे जाओ। कैंसिल करो अपने प्लान को। तो Adobe आपको खुद ऑफर करेगा कि यार आपको अगर और एक्स्ट्रा टाइम चाहिए सोचने के लिए, तो आप और एक्स्ट्रा दिन यूज़ कर सकते हो हमारी सर्विसेज को। तो क्या बुरा है भाई? ले लेना उस वक्त। लेकिन मान लो कि आपका ट्रायल एंड हो चुका है। आप एक महीना यूज़ कर चुके थे और फिर आप कैंसिल करने जाते हो तो AOB आपको डिस्काउंटेड प्राइस ऑफर करता है। तो आप वो डिस्काउंटेड प्राइस का भी इस्तेमाल कर सकते हो। और फिर क्या डन? लेकिन डन से याद आया। मैंने तुम्हें स्किल मैट्रिक्स के बारे में नहीं बताया। वो यह रहा। मैं मिलता हूं आपको अगली वीडियो में। तब तक के लिए बी बिजी।",
