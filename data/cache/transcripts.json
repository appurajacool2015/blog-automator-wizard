    "data": "you would have often heard the phrase that timing the market is less important than time in the market that if you invest for a long period of time you will definitely make returns but what does the data tell us so let me talk about two very important phases of the Indian stock market from the year 1999 nifty50 or Indian index was roughly at 1,000 points okay and in the next 9 years it went to roughly 5,000 points so there was a 5x gain in the 9 years then 2008 crisis happened market took some time to stabilize and then if you consider the data from roughly 20101 all the way till 2020 when the COVID crisis hit the market went from roughly 5 1/2 6,000 all the way till 12,000 so in this 9-year phase markets only went 2x or two times so first phase 5x second phase 2x now many money managers tell you that hey if you invest for the next 20 years your wealth will grow at like you know CADR of 30% 50% 100% etc etc but the point is that intelligently investing is absolutely critical for example right now the Trump tariff has been announced there are recessionary concerns the market is panicking so during such times you must invest some money if you don't time the market intelligently you will not make much money in the market now to learn more finance follow this",
